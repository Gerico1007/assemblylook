Memory dump of ChatGPT's ideas: 

Here are some solid resources to help transform GitHub into your personal Asana/Jira for structured, PMBOK-style planning—without writing a single line of code:

---

## 📋 1. PMBOK Documentation Templates (Markdown)

* **jerzydziewierz/PMBOK-doc-templates** — A polished, modular collection of markdown templates aligned with PMBOK 6th edition.

  * Includes project charters, plans, process guides, risk registers, stakeholder matrices, and more ([github.com][1]).
  * Ideal starting point for creating a personal or team-level structured project vault in your repo.

---

## 🛠 2. GitHub Issue & PR Templates

* GitHub supports **multiple issue templates** configured via `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
* YAML or Markdown templates can include front matter (`name`, `labels`, `assignees`) to enforce consistency and structure ([docs.github.com][2], [docs.github.com][3]).
* Useful for tracking tasks, risks, action items, decision logs, etc., in a standardized format.

---

## 📈 3. GitHub Projects (v2) as PM Boards

* Use **GitHub Projects** to organize issues into Kanban boards, roadmaps, task lists—but it’s not limited to code:

  * You can create private, per-repo or org-level projects for personal initiatives (e.g., book writing, home renovation) .
* Customize views, add custom fields (dates, risk levels, status), and automate transitions (e.g., “Close → Done”).

---

## ✔️ 4. Task Lists & Checklists in Issues

* Use **GitHub-flavoured markdown** to embed checklists in issues or PRs.
* Each item can be checked off, turned into sub-issues, and dragged across project boards ([docs.github.com][4], [github.blog][5]).
* Great for embedding step-by-step procedures, risk logs, or acceptance criteria directly into tracked items.

---

## 📚 5. Inspirational Personal PM Workflows

* **Dev.to “New‑Year Planning”** — Shows how individuals set up private GitHub Projects to track resolutions and goals ([dev.to][6]).
* **reddit/r/webdev thread** — Users recommend personal, private repos + GitHub Projects/Issues for everything from solo work to chores ([reddit.com][7]).

---

## ✅ Suggested Template Stack for You

1. **Initialize Repo**

   * Add `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` with structured issue templates:

     * **Task**, **Decision**, **Risk**, **Meeting Summary**, **Document Review**

2. **Add PMBOK Modules**

   * Drop in `jerzydziewierz/PMBOK-doc-templates` under `docs/`, selectively using:

     * `Project Charter`, `Scope Statement`, `Risk Register`, `Stakeholder Register`

3. **Kickoff GitHub Project Board**

   * Create a private “Personal PM” project using the **Team Planning** template.
   * Add custom fields: Priority, Risk, Due Date, Stakeholder

4. **Use Issue Checklists & Links**

   * In each issue, embed checklists like:

     ```markdown
     - [ ] Define objective
     - [ ] Identify risks
     - [ ] Create schedule
     ```
   * Use “Convert to issue” to spin off sub-tasks as needed.

5. **Automate Status & Reminders**

   * Use Projects automation: move an issue to “Done” when closed.
   * Use GitHub Actions or Gemini CLI to label stale items or add due-date warnings.

---

## 💡 Why This Works

* **Zero additional tools**: Everything runs inside GitHub (private repos + Projects + issues).
* **Ultimate portability**: Accessible via UI, CLI, or mobile.
* **Memorability + Structure**: Combine issue templates, project boards, and PMBOK docs for discipline.
* **AI-Ready**: Tools like Gemini CLI can interpret, update, and act on these consistently organized files — powered by your memory bank.
