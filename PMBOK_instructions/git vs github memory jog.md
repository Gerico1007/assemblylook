### 📌 **What `git` vs `gh` can do — side by side**

| **Category**             | **Action**            | **`git`**                                                   | **`gh`**                                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local Work**           | Make commits          | ✅ `git commit` creates local commits.                       | ❌ `gh` does not do this.                           |
| **Sync Own Repo**        | Pull from your remote | ✅ `git pull` fetches & merges/rebases.                      | ❌ `gh` does not pull.                              |
| **Sync Own Repo**        | Push to your remote   | ✅ `git push` uploads local commits.                         | ❌ `gh` does not push; it sets up auth.             |
| **Auth Setup**           | Handle credentials    | 🔑 Uses credential helper you set                           | ✅ `gh auth login` sets up PAT or SSH key.          |
| **Create Repo**          | Make new GitHub repo  | ❌ `git` can’t do this.                                      | ✅ `gh repo create` makes one online.               |
| **Fork Repo**            | Fork someone’s repo   | ❌ `git` can’t fork, only clone.                             | ✅ `gh repo fork` calls GitHub’s API.               |
| **Clone Repo**           | Copy any repo         | ✅ `git clone` works for any readable repo.                  | ✅ `gh repo clone` wraps `git clone`.               |
| **Issues**               | Manage issues         | ❌ `git` does not know about issues.                         | ✅ `gh issue list/create/view` uses API.            |
| **Pull Requests**        | Create/merge PRs      | ❌ `git` does not know PRs exist.                            | ✅ `gh pr create/merge` talks to API.               |
| **Contribute to Others** | PR to another repo    | ✅ `git clone` → branch → commit → push fork → PR by browser | ✅ `gh` does same but `gh pr create` automates it.  |
| **CI/CD**                | Manage workflows      | ❌ `git` has no clue about CI/CD.                            | ✅ `gh workflow` commands run/check GitHub Actions. |

### ⚙️ **Key point, no sugarcoating**

* `git` is raw plumbing: version control, pure data ops.
* `gh` is the polite butler: sets up tokens, talks to the GitHub *web API*.
* They don’t talk to each other live — `gh` just wires up the keys so `git` can push/pull securely.
* For *your* repo: `git push` works if you have a valid token/key.
* For *someone else’s* repo: no direct push. You fork (with `gh` or website), push *to the fork*, then open a PR (browser or `gh`).

Gemini CLI can operate both, e.g. `gh issue`
