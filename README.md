# Puzzles_for_AIs
Source materials with puzzles for AIs, LLMs and some wetware. 


These used to be Gists here, but Markdown looks better. 


Update: 
They are messy for now and somewhat outdated, as I was too lazy to copy them off Asana (where the originals reside), but now I figured out how to make Gemini CLI operate in both via APIs or MCPs so expect much more interesting stuff here in due course.
