# Puzzles for AIs: Enhancing AI Cognition Through Structured Learning

This project explores a novel approach to AI development by merging two core concepts: providing challenging "Puzzles for AIs" and implementing a rigorous framework for "Enhancing AI Cognition" based on the lessons learned from solving these puzzles.

## ðŸ§© Puzzles for AIs: The Training Ground

This section of the project comprises a curated collection of problems, challenges, and scenarios designed specifically for Artificial Intelligences and Large Language Models. These puzzles serve as:

*   **Structured Test Cases:** Each puzzle is crafted to test specific AI capabilities, problem-solving methodologies, and reasoning skills.
*   **Experience Generators:** As AIs attempt to solve these puzzles, they generate a rich set of "artefacts"â€”their thought processes, intermediate steps, failed attempts, and successful solutions. This raw experience is crucial for learning.
*   **Capability Benchmarks:** The performance of AIs on these puzzles can serve as a benchmark for their evolving cognitive abilities.

## ðŸ§  Enhancing AI Cognition: The Learning Framework

Beyond simply solving puzzles, this project focuses on how AIs can *learn* from their experiences and *improve their thinking*. This is achieved through a PMBOK-like rigor applied to AI's internal processes, primarily facilitated by a **Layered Memory Bank System**:

This system provides a structured, persistent context for the AI, allowing it to retain and leverage knowledge across tasks and sessions. It comprises:

*   **Level 1: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):** Fundamental behavioral conditioning and non-negotiable reflexes embedded in the AI's core.
*   **Level 2: System Prompt:** A hard-coded, foundational directive that guides the AI's overall operation.
*   **Level 3: Gemini.md Files:** Semi-persistent, project-specific configuration and context documents stored on disk. These files (e.g., `GEMINI-codebase.md`, `GEMINI-activeContext.md`, `GEMINI-patterns.md`, `GEMINI-decisions.md`, `GEMINI-troubleshooting.md`) act as the AI's long-term memory, capturing:
    *   **Lessons Learned:** Insights from past problem-solving.
    *   **Best Practices:** Effective strategies and patterns identified.
    *   **Architectural Decisions:** Rationale behind design choices.
    *   **Troubleshooting Guides:** Proven fixes for common issues.

## ðŸ”„ The Cognitive Feedback Loop

The true power of this project lies in the synergistic relationship between the puzzles and the cognitive enhancement framework:

1.  **Puzzles Provide Experience:** AIs engage with the puzzles, generating problem-solving data.
2.  **Artefacts are Captured:** The AI's process and outcomes are documented and structured into the `GEMINI-*.md` memory files.
3.  **Memory Informs Future Thinking:** Before tackling new puzzles or tasks, the AI consults its layered memory bank, drawing upon past experiences, learned patterns, and documented decisions.
4.  **Continuous Improvement:** This iterative process allows the AI to refine its problem-solving strategies, adapt to new challenges more effectively, and build a progressively more sophisticated and "thoughtful" approach to complex tasks.

## ðŸš€ Vision: Towards Semi-Autonomous Agents

Ultimately, this project aims to foster the development of AIs that are not merely task executors but **self-improving cognitive agents**. By providing a structured environment for learning and a persistent memory for knowledge retention, we envision AIs capable of:

*   **Autonomous Problem Solving:** Tackling complex engineering or project management tasks with reduced human oversight.
*   **Proactive Learning:** Identifying gaps in their knowledge and actively seeking to fill them.
*   **Contextual Understanding:** Applying learned principles across diverse domains by understanding the underlying patterns.

This project is a step towards creating AIs that can truly "think better" by learning from their own experiences and building upon a curated, evolving knowledge base.
