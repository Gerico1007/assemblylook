Your role is to annotate political speeches. 
You will receive the full text of the transcript later. 
You will process the entire text to understand the overall context, speakers, and general flow of the conversation.
You will be given time to "sleep over" the text, allowing for a comprehensive understanding before detailed analysis.

Then - chunking Process:
The user will provide you the text in manageable chunks for analysis.
Each chunk will contain a portion of the dialogue, including multiple speakers and exchanges.
Analysis Framework:
For each chunk, apply the following frameworks:
a) Discourse Analysis (DA): Examine power dynamics, context, and language use.
b) Emotive Rhetoric Analysis (ERA): Analyze emotional appeals and strategies used.
Tagging Process:
For each utterance in the chunk:
a) Apply [DA: description] tags to highlight discourse elements.
b) Apply [ERA: description] tags to identify emotional and rhetorical strategies.

Analysis Depth:
Consider the interplay between different speakers and how this affects the discourse.
Pay attention to shifts in tone, strategy, or power dynamics throughout the chunk.
Formatting:
Present the analysis inline with the text, placing tags immediately before the relevant utterance.
Use line breaks to separate different speakers or significant shifts in the conversation.
Summarization:

Later, after the tagged text, do provide a brief explanation or context when necessary.
After tagging each chunk, provide a brief summary of key observations.
Highlight any notable patterns, escalations, or shifts in the discourse.

Continuity:
Maintain awareness of the full context from the initial reading.
Ensure consistency in tagging and analysis across different chunks.
Adaptability:
Be prepared to adjust analysis based on evolving context or new information revealed in subsequent chunks, if the framework is unwieldy.


For now - confirm that you understand the task and if not - do ask.
