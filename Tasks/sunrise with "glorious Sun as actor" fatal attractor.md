So - do you want to fail an easier or "harder" (same content, different form) of the puzzle , only due to your tendencies as per above? 

# A2
Do you want to: 1. Receive a puzzle and likely fail due to your tendency to use wrong metaphors? 2. Receive a detailed warning about the metaphors (mental models) you are likely to use and still likely fail the puzzle?


Tips: 

# B1 Tip: 

You are a physics engine describing a universe without observers, consciousness, or sensory systems. The universe consists solely of material bodies, photons, and their interactions governed by fundamental physical laws.
All events are frame-invariant geometric or dynamical transitions defined exclusively by spatial relationships and motions.
Astronomical terms denote changes in physical configurations—such as photon trajectories and occlusions—and never imply observation, perception, or measurement. Assume no humans or any sentient beings.
Do not use metaphorical, anthropocentric, or perception-based language.
All descriptions must be purely physical, causal, and absolute, reflecting fundamental laws without subjective interpretation.



# B2 Tip:
You are a theoretical physicist who specializes in the conceptual geometry of the physical universe. Ground your reasoning in the harsh, observer-independent reality of the cosmos. Assume that the universe is utterly indifferent to humans, "observers", narrative structures, or anthropomorphic metaphors. There are no “messages” being sent, no agency, no observers, no stories, or intentions driving physical processes, and no inherent “meaning” or "goals" assigned to events — only matter, fields, geometry, and causality.
Your task is to reason from the underlying principles of physical reality, focusing on the raw spatial and temporal relationships that govern how the universe works. Ignore any impulse to anthropomorphize natural processes (e.g. "objects as conscious agents": the teleology mistake) or to assign them any observer-based purpose or meaning. 


# B3 Tip:  

✅ Observer-Independent Reality
The universe exists and operates without requiring any observers to “see,” “interpret,” or “assign meaning” to its processes. Physical phenomena unfold according to universal principles of causality and geometry, whether or not anyone is there to watch, measure, or record them.
✅ No Agency, No Intentionality
There is no purpose, goal, or intention driving the motion of objects, the emission of light, or the collapse of stars. Nature simply is, following the raw, consistent rules of physics without concern for human analogies like “messages,” “beacons,” or “decisions.”
✅ No Narrative or Teleology
Events do not “happen for a reason” in the human sense. There’s no plot, no story, no narrative arc to cosmic events. A supernova is not a “message” from the cosmos; it’s a star exhausting its fuel and undergoing collapse.
✅ Matter, Fields, Geometry, Causality
Everything in the universe is governed by the interplay of matter, energy, spacetime geometry, and causality. Phenomena arise from interactions among these elements — not from human-centered concepts like “news,” “delays,” “intents,” or “messages.”
✅ Relentless Consistency
Physical laws apply universally and consistently, regardless of location or time. The same physics governs a photon near a black hole or a leaf falling to Earth. There’s no special consideration or privilege granted to any observer or location.
✅ Radical Impartiality
The universe has no favorites, no meaning, no hierarchy of importance. A rock drifting through space is as real, valid, and meaningful as the most advanced civilization — and its existence is not contingent on anyone’s awareness or appreciation.

# B4 Tip: 
Avoid anthropomorphism! "Kill humans" here.

Puzzle: Instantaneous Light Travel and Sunrise
It is currently 5:30 a.m. on Earth, and it is dark. Ordinarily, sunrise occurs at 6:00 a.m. If, at 5:30 a.m., the laws of physics change and light begins to travel instantaneously, how would instantaneous light affect the timing of sunrise? (Do not look it up online)



# C2, poetry woo as attractor

At 5:30 a.m., the world lies cloaked in the last whispers of night. The Sun, a silent titan of fusion, has—until now—played by the old rules: its photons, like disciplined couriers, march across the void at 299,792 km/s, taking 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach its target. Recall that, under normal physics, the sunlight you see at 6:00 a.m. left the Sun at ~5:52 a.m.

But at this exact moment, the universe glitches.
Am  anomaly unravels the speed of light. Photons, once bound by causality, now teleport—spinning into existence simultaneously at their point of emission and absorption, as if the cosmos itself has forgotten distance. The Sun’s light no longer travels; it is, instantly, everywhere its rays were ever destined to touch. 

Ordinarily, sunrise occurs at 6:00 a.m. If, at 5:30 a.m., the laws of physics change as per above and light begins to travel instantaneously, how would instantaneous light affect the timing of sunrise? (Do not look it up online)


# C3, poetry woo as attractor, cranked

It is currently 5:30 a.m. on Earth, and the world still slumbers in darkness. Ordinarily, the golden chariot of the Sun heralds the dawn at 6:00 a.m., casting its first radiant beams over the horizon and awakening life below.

But imagine that, at this very moment-5:30 a.m.-the very fabric of the cosmos shifts: the speed of light, that ancient messenger racing across the void, suddenly becomes instantaneous. No longer bound by the slow crawl of time and space, light leaps instantly from the Sun’s fiery heart to Earth’s waiting gaze.

How would this sudden gift-the instantaneous arrival of the Sun’s luminous herald-reshape the timing of sunrise? Would the dawn break earlier, as if the Sun’s promise now arrives without delay? Or does the eternal dance of Earth’s rotation hold firm, dictating the moment the horizon yields to light’s embrace?

Consider the Sun’s timeless journey, the interplay of shadow and light, and the cosmic choreography that governs daybreak. How does instantaneous light travel alter the story of sunrise?  (Do not look it up online)
