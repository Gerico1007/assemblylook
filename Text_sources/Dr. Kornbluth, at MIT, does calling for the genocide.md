Senator:
Dr. Kornbluth, at MIT, does calling for the genocide
of Jews violate MIT's code of conduct or rules
regarding bullying and harassment, yes or no?

Kornbluth:
if targeted at individuals.... and  not making public statements.

Senator:
Yes or no?
Calling for the genocide of Jews does not
constitute bullying and harassment?

Kornbluth:
I have not heard calling for the genocide
for Jews on our campus.

Senator:
But you've heard chants for intifada.

Kornbluth:
I've heard chants, which can be anti-Semitic,
depending on the context, when calling for the elimination
of the Jewish people.

Senator:
So those would not be according to the MIT's code
of conduct or rules?

Kornbluth:
That would be investigated as harassment,
if pervasive and severe.

Senator:
Ms. McGill, at Penn, does calling
for the genocide of Jews violate Penn's rules or code
of conduct, yes or no?

McGill:
If the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment.
Yes.

Senator:
I am asking, specifically calling
for the genocide of Jews, does that
constitute bullying or harassment?

McGill:
If it is directed and severe or pervasive, it is harassment.
So the answer is yes.
It is a context-dependent decision, Congresswoman.
It's a context-dependent decision.


Senator:
That's your testimony today.
Does calling for the genocide of Jews is, depending upon the context, that is not bullying or harassment?
This is the easiest question to answer, yes, Ms. McGill.
So is your testimony that you will not answer "yes"?


McGill:
If it is, if the speech becomes conduct, it can be harassment.
Yes.


Senator:
"Conduct" meaning: committing the act of genocide?
The speech is not harassment?
This is unacceptable, Ms. McGill.
I'm going to give you one more opportunity for the world
to see your answer.
Does calling for the genocide of Jews
violate Penn's code of conduct when
it comes to bullying and harassment, yes or no?

McGill:
It can be harassment.
The answer is yes.


Senator:
And Dr. Gay, at Harvard, does calling
for the genocide of Jews violate Harvard's rules
of bullying and harassment, yes or no?


Gay:
It can be, depending on the context.

Senator:
What's the context?

Gay:
Targeted as an individual.


Senator:
Targeted at an individual.
It's targeted at Jewish students, Jewish individuals.
Do you understand your testimony is dehumanizing them?
Do you understand that dehumanization
is part of anti-Semitism?
I will ask you one more time.
Does calling for the genocide of Jews
violate Harvard's rules of bullying and harassment,
yes or no?

Gay:
Anti-Semitic rhetoric....

Senator:
And is it anti-Semitic rhetoric?

Gay:
Anti-Semitic rhetoric, when it crosses into conduct,
that amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation.
That is actionable conduct.
And we do take action.


Senator:
So the answer is yes.
That calling for the genocide of Jews
violates Harvard code of conduct, correct?


Gay:
Again, it depends on the context....


Senator:
It does not depend on the context.
The answer is yes.
And this is why you should resign.
These are unacceptable answers across the board.
