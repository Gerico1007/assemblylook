[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

3
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,951
[SPEAKER_01][Setting Up Argument]: I'm going to continue down that vein.

4
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:11,514
[SPEAKER_01][Highlighting Non-Compliance]: You have been here sitting today, Director Cheadle, definitively able to dismiss erroneous information and speculation.

5
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:17,296
[SPEAKER_01][Highlighting Non-Compliance][Accusation]: However, you are refusing to answer questions that we now know that you have the information for.

6
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:24,498
[SPEAKER_01][Highlighting Non-Compliance][Accusation]: You are saying that you are wanting to answer questions that the Secret Service has information to.

7
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,279
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Well, ma'am, you are the Secret Service.

8
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:27,639
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: You are the director.

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:29,960
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: You have said that you are the best for the job.

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:40,886
[SPEAKER_01][Highlighting Non-Compliance][Accusation][Demand for Specificity]: So I'm going to ask you some questions now, now knowing that you do have answers from the FBI whom you have been passing the buck to this entire day.

11
00:00:41,426 --> 00:00:47,349
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: And I'll start with something that, you know, maybe the FBI doesn't know because it has to do with you personally.

12
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:52,332
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: You said you spoke with President Trump after the assassination attempt.

13
00:00:52,372 --> 00:00:58,375
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation][Demand for Specificity]: And I want to know, did you apologize to him directly for nearly having President Trump killed?

14
00:00:59,636 --> 00:01:00,116
[SPEAKER_02][Admission]: Yes, I did.

15
00:01:01,397 --> 00:01:02,217
[SPEAKER_01][Acknowledgment]: I appreciate that.

16
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:07,279
[SPEAKER_01][Acknowledgment][Highlighting Non-Compliance]: I appreciate that you recognize that this was your failure.

17
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:12,320
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Now, since the assassination attempt, you are under oath, reminding you.

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:19,322
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Have you communicated with anyone at the White House on an encrypted messaging app like Signal?

19
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:23,763
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity][Repetition]: Yes or no?

20
00:01:24,104 --> 00:01:24,784
[SPEAKER_02][Denial]: No, I have not.

21
00:01:25,564 --> 00:01:28,825
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Are you willing to surrender your personal phone for analysis?

22
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,096
[SPEAKER_02][Conditional Compliance]: if I am required to do so.

23
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:33,796
[SPEAKER_01][Acknowledgment]: Okay.

24
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:41,900
[SPEAKER_01][Implied Threat]: I will look into making that request because I would like to see your personal phone to see if you're communicating over encrypted messaging apps.

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:50,283
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Have you ever turned down enhanced security requests from Donald Trump's detail, his special agent in charge, Sean Curran?

26
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:52,504
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity][Repetition]: Have you ever turned that down?

27
00:01:53,264 --> 00:01:54,045
[SPEAKER_02][Denial]: No, I have not.

28
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:59,467
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Have there been requests, has your team has a secret service?

29
00:02:00,543 --> 00:02:01,584
[SPEAKER_01][Clarification]: Maybe not you personally.

30
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:07,208
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: I believe, as I mentioned earlier, there are times when requests are made for assets.

31
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:08,049
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: And you have denied them.

32
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:09,090
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation][Repetition]: They have been denied.

33A
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,575
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: And a denial doesn't necessarily mean... 

33B
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,575
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity][Interruption]: Has the Trump campaign made requests for additional assets that have been denied?

34
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:17,097
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: Denial doesn't mean vulnerability.

35
00:02:18,177 --> 00:02:21,160
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Have there been additional requests for enhanced security at Mar-a-Lago?

36
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:25,624
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: We have made a number of enhancements to security.

37
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,526
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: You confirmed that there were bomb-sniffing dogs that were provided.

38
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:35,263
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: You failed to confirm if there were aerial security surveillance assets that were provided.

39
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:36,203
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: So yes or no?

40
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:37,423
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity][Repetition]: Was that provided?

41
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:39,644
[SPEAKER_02][Clarification]: At the rally?

42
00:02:39,664 --> 00:02:40,624
[SPEAKER_01][Clarification]: At the rally, yes ma'am.

43
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:43,645
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Overwatch provided at the rally.

44
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:49,887
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: You've confirmed that the assassin was identified as suspicious 57 minutes prior to the shooting.

45
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:54,968
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Was the suspicious individual ever approached by an agent?

46
00:02:58,482 --> 00:02:59,963
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity][Repetition]: Was any contact ever made with him?

47
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:01,664
[SPEAKER_02][Stonewalling]: Not to my knowledge.

80
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:09,609
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Will you be able to tell us if he communicated with other agents on what he was seeing through his sites?

81
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,012
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: Once I have that information, absolutely.

82
00:05:13,592 --> 00:05:21,799
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation][Demand for Specificity]: Because we need to know why he waited for multiple rounds to be fired at President Trump before the threat was neutralized.

83
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,602
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: We need to know if he was given an order to hold fire.

84
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:32,829
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: Now, you've excused the roof of being unmanned because of the slope of the roof.

85
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:39,920
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Do you continue to assert the slope of the roof as a credible reason for leaving this position undefended?

86
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:46,125
[SPEAKER_02][Clarification]: First, I'll go back and correct that there was no order to hold fire.

87
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:53,490
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: Our agents and officers have the ability to neutralize a threat at the time that they see it.

88
00:05:53,590 --> 00:06:01,455
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation][Highlighting Non-Compliance]: I'm sorry, you don't know the communication that was taking place or how long he had admitted sites because you haven't spoke to him, but you do know that there was no order to hold fire.

89
00:06:01,755 --> 00:06:04,097
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: I can tell you the way that our personnel are trained.

90
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:11,081
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: They are trained on the use of force scale that when they see a threat, they are authorized to neutralize that threat.

91
00:06:12,262 --> 00:06:13,724
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: They don't have to ask for permission.

92
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,008
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation][Repetition]: You excuse the roof being unmanned because of the slope.

93
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:19,590
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Do you stand by that assertion?

94
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:26,017
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: The roof was not covered with an individual on it because there was overwatch provided.

95
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:28,239
[SPEAKER_01][Sarcasm/Irony]: Apparently not.

96
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,680
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: No, there was no Overwatch provided.

97
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,481
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: This is very evident.

98
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:34,042
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: President Trump was shot.

99
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:35,163
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: A man died.

100
00:06:35,543 --> 00:06:37,544
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: There was no oversight provided.

101
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:50,873
[SPEAKER_01][Frustration][Accusation]: I find this rather maddening, especially now knowing that you do have answers from the FBI, who you have been passing the buck to this entire hearing, not answering a congressional hearing.

102
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:56,216
[SPEAKER_01][Frustration][Accusation]: Members of Congress, while you are under oath and under a subpoena, I find it maddening that the director

103
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:03,161
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: that our country has come centimeters away from oblivion under your watch.

104
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:04,482
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: You have answers.

105
00:07:04,522 --> 00:07:10,705
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation][Highlighting Non-Compliance]: You are refusing to give those to us, directing us to the FBI.

106
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:14,047
[SPEAKER_01][Frustration]: And this entire thing is a waste of time.

107
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:22,512
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: You are responsible for the loss of a life and the shooting that took place on President Trump.

108
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,342
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: You do need to resign.

109
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:25,383
[SPEAKER_01][Appeal to Authority]: This is bipartisan.

110
00:07:25,763 --> 00:07:26,783
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: You need to be fired.

111
00:07:27,164 --> 00:07:28,504
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: You do not need to hold this position.

112
00:07:28,544 --> 00:07:29,945
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: You are not the best for this job.

113
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:39,248
[SPEAKER_01][Implied Threat]: I am over my time, but I cannot tolerate your watch any longer, and I'm going to continue to call daily for you to be removed from your position, ma'am.

114
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:41,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Chair recognizes Mr. Fryer from South Carolina.

115
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:42,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
