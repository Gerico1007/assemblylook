You are now called to redress a great transgression. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] Seldom in the history of nations has such a question been presented. Tariffs, Army bills, navy bills, land bills, are important, and justly occupy your care; but these all belong to the course of ordinary legislation. As means and instruments only, they are necessarily subordinate to the conservation of Government itself. Grant them or deny them, in greater or less degree, and you will inflict no shock. The machinery of Government will continue to move. The State will not cease to exist. Far otherwise is it with the eminent question now before you, involving, as it does, Liberty in a broad Territory, and also involving the peace of the whole country with our good name in our history for evermore. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭]
Take down your map, sir, and you will find that the Territory of Kansas occupies the middle spot of North America, equally distant from the Atlantic on the east, and the Pacific on the west; from the frozen waters of Hudson's Bay on the north, and the tepid Gulf Stream on the south, constituting the precise territorial centre of the whole vast continent. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] To such advantages of situation, on the very highway between two oceans, are added a soil of unsurpassed richness, and a fascinating, undulating beauty of surface, with a health-giving climate, calculated to nurture a powerful and generous people, worthy to be a central pivot of American Institutions. [Imagery and Descriptive Language 🎨] A few short months only have passed since this spacious Mediterranean country was open only to the savage, who ran wild in its woods and prairies; [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] and now it has already drawn to its bosom a population of freemen larger than Athens crowded within her historic gates, [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] when her sons, under Miltiades, won Liberty for mankind on the field of Marathon; [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] more than Sparta contained when she ruled Greece, and sent forth her devoted children, quickened by a mother's benediction, to return with their shields or on them; [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] more than Rome gathered on her seven hills, when, under her kings, she commenced that sovereign sway, which afterwards embraced the whole earth; [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] more than London held, when, on the fields of Crecy and Agincourt, the English banner was carried victoriously over the chivalrous hosts of France. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] 



Against this Territory, thus fortunate in position and population, a crime has been committed, which is without example in the records of the Past. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Not in plundered provinces or in the cruelties of selfish governors will you find its parallel; [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] and yet there is an ancient instance, which may show at least the path of justice. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] In the terrible impeachment by which the great Roman orator has blasted through all time the name of Verres amidst charges of robbery and sacrilege, [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] the enormity which most aroused the indignant voice of his accuser, and which still stands forth with strongest distinctness, arresting the sympathetic indignation of all who read the story, is that away in Sicily he had scourged a citizen of Rome — that the cry "I am a Roman citizen" had been interposed in vain against the lash of the tyrant governor. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] Other charges were that he had carried away productions of art, and that he had violated the sacred shrines. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] It was in the presence of the Roman Senate that this arraignment proceeded, in a temple of the forum; amidst crowds — such as no orator had ever before drawn together — thronging the porticos and colonades, even clinging to the housetops and neighboring slopes, and under the anxious gaze of witnesses summoned from the scene of the crime. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] But an audience grander far, of higher dignity, of more various people and of wider intelligence, the countless multitude of succeeding generations in every land where eloquence has been studied, or where the Roman name has been recognised, has listened to the accusation, and throbbed with condemnation of the criminal. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] Sir, speaking in an age of light, and in a land of constitutional liberty, where the safeguards of elections are justly placed among the highest triumphs of civilization, I fearlessly assert that the wrongs of much-abused Sicily, thus memorable in history, were small by the side of the wrongs of Kansas, where the very shrines of popular institutions, more sacred than any heathen altar, have been desecrated; [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] where the ballot box, more precious than any work, in ivory or marble, from the cunning hand of art, has been plundered; and where the cry "I am an American citizen" has been interposed in vain against outrage of every kind, even upon life itself. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Are you against sacrilege? I present it for your execration. Are you against robbery? I hold it up to your scorn. Are you for the protection of American citizens? I show you how their dearest rights have been cloven down, while a tyrannical usurpation has sought to install itself on their very necks! [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢]
But the wickedness which I now begin to expose is immeasurably aggravated by the motive which prompted it. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Not in any common lust for power did this uncommon tragedy have its origin. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] It is the rape of a virgin Territory, compelling it to the hateful embrace of Slavery; and it may be clearly traced to a depraved longing for a new slave State, the hideous offspring of such a crime, in the hope of adding to the power of slavery in the National Government. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Yes, sir, when the whole world, alike Christian and Turk, is rising up to condemn this wrong, and to make it a hissing to the nations, here in our Republic, force — aye, Sir, FORCE, — has been openly employed in compelling Kansas to this pollution, and all for the sake of political power. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] There is the simple fact, which you will vainly attempt to deny, but which in itself presents an essential wickedness that makes other public crimes seem like public virtues. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] 


But this enormity, vast beyond comparison, swells to dimensions of wickedness which the imagination toils in vain to grasp, [Hyperbole for Effect 💬] when it is understood, that for this purpose are hazarded the horrors of intestine feud, not only in this distant Territory, but everywhere throughout the country. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Already the muster has begun. [Contrasts and Juxtaposition 🔗] The strife is no longer local, but national. [Contrasts and Juxtaposition 🔗] Even now, while I speak, portents hang on all the arches of the horizon, threatening to darken the broad land, which already yawns with the musterings of civil war. [Imagery and Descriptive Language 🎨] The fury of the propagandists of slavery, and the calm determination of their opponents, are now diffused from the distant Territory over wide-spread communities, and the whole country, in all its extent — marshalling hostile divisions, and foreshadowing a strife, which, unless happily averted by the triumph of Freedom, will become war — fratricidal, parricidal war — with an accumulated wickedness beyond the wickedness of any war in human annals; [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] justly provoking the avenging judgment of Providence and the avenging pen of history, and constituting a strife, in the language of the ancient writer, more than foreign, more than social, more than civil; but something compounded of all these strifes, and in itself more than war; [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] ’’sed potius commune quoddam ex omnibus, et plus quam bellum.’’ [Foreign Phrase 🌐]
Such is the crime which you are to judge. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] But the criminal also must be dragged into day, that you may see and measure the power by which all this wrong is sustained. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] From no common source could it proceed. In its perpetration was needed a spirit of vaulting ambition which would hesitate at nothing; a hardihood of purpose which was insensible to the judgment of mankind; a madness for slavery which should disregard the Constitution, the laws, and all the great examples of our history; [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] also a consciousness of power such as comes from the habit of power; a combination of energies found only in a hundred arms directed by a hundred eyes; a control of public opinion, through venal pens and a prostituted press; an ability to subsidize crowds in every vocation of life — the politician with his local importance, the lawyer with his subtile tongue, and even the authority of the judge on the bench, and a familiar use of men in places high and low, so that none, from the President to the lowest border postmaster, should decline to be its tool; [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] all these things and more were needed; and they were found in the slave power of our Republic. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] There, sir, stands the criminal — all unmasked before you — heartless, grasping, and tyrannical — with an audacity beyond that of Verres, a subtlety beyond that of Machiavel, a meanness beyond that of Bacon, and an ability beyond that of Hastings. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Justice to Kansas can be secured only by the prostration of this influence; for this is the power behind, — greater than any President — which succors and sustains the Crime. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Nay, the proceedings I now arraign derive their fearful consequence only from this connection. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] 

In now opening this great matter, I am not insensible to the austere demands of the occasion; [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] but the dependence of the crime against Kansas upon the slave power is so peculiar and important, that I trust to be pardoned while I impress it by an illustration, which to some may seem trivial. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] It is related in Northern mythology, that the god of Force, visiting an enchanted region, was challenged by his royal entertainer to what seemed a humble feat of strength—merely, sir, to lift a cat from the ground. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] The god smiled at the challenge, and, calmly placing his hand under the belly of the animal, with superhuman strength, strove, while the back of the feline monster arched far upward, even beyond reach, and one paw actually forsook the earth, until at last the discomfited divinity desisted; [Metaphorical Language 🌐] but he was little surprised at his defeat, when he learned that this creature, which seemed to be a cat, and nothing more, was not merely a cat, but that it belonged to and was a part of the great terrestrial serpent, which, in its innumerable folds, encircled the whole globe. [Metaphorical Language 🌐] Even so to the creature whose paws are now fastened upon Kansas, whatever it may seem to be, constitutes in reality a part of the Slave Power, which, with loathsome folds, now coiled about the whole land. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Thus do I expose the extent of the present contest, where we encounter not merely local resistance, but also the unconquered sustaining arm behind. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] But out of the vastness of the crime attempted, with all its woe and shame, I derive a well-founded assurance of a commensurate vastness of effort against it, by the aroused masses of the country, determined not only to vindicate Right against Wrong, but to redeem the republic from the thraldom of that oligarchy which prompts, directs, and concentrates, the distant wrong. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢]
Such is the Crime, and such the criminal which it is my duty in this debate to expose; [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] and, by the blessing of God, this duty shall be done completely to the end. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] But this will not be enough. The Apologies, which, with strange hardihood, have been offered for the Crime, must be torn away, so that it shall stand forth without a single rag or fig-leaf to cover its vileness; [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] and, finally, the true remedy must be shown. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] The subject is as complex in its relations as it is transcendent in importance; and yet, if I am honored by your attention, I hope to exhibit it clearly in all its parts, while I conduct you to the inevitable conclusion, that Kansas must be admitted at once, with her present Constitution, as a State of this Union, and give a new star to the blue field of our national flag. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] And here I derive satisfaction from the thought that the cause is so strong in itself as to bear even the infirmities of its advocates; nor can it require anything beyond that simplicity of treatment and moderation of manner which I desire to cultivate. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] Its true character is such that like Hercules, it will conquer just so soon as it is recognised. [Metaphorical Language 🌐] My task will be divided under three different heads: first, THE CRIME AGAINST KANSAS, in its origin and extent; secondly, THE APOLOGIES FOR THE CRIME; and thirdly, the TRUE REMEDY. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭]

But, before entering upon the argument, I must say something of a general character, particularly in response to what has fallen from senators who have raised themselves to eminence on this floor in championship of human wrongs. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] I mean the senator from South Carolina, (Mr. BUTLER,) and the senator from Illinois, (Mr. DOUGLAS,) who, though unlike as Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, yet, like this couple, sally forth together in the same adventure. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] I regret much to miss the elder senator from his seat; but the cause, against which he has run a tilt with such activity of animosity, demands that the opportunity of exposing him should not be lost; and it is for the cause that I speak. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] The senator from South Carolina has read many books of chivalry, and believes himself a chivalrous knight with sentiments of honor and courage. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] Of course he has chosen a mistress to whom he has made his vows, and who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight — I mean the harlot, slavery. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] For her his tongue is always profuse in words. Let her be impeached in character, or any proposition made to shut her out from the extension of her wantonness, and no extravagance of manner or hardihood of assertion is then too great for this senator. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] The phrenzy of Don Quixote in behalf of his wench Dulcinea del Toboso is all surpassed. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] The asserted rights of slavery, which shock equality of all kinds, are cloaked by a fantastic claim of equality. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] If the slave States cannot enjoy what in mockery of the great fathers of the Republic, he misnames equality under the Constitution — in other words, the full power in the national Territories to compel fellow men to unpaid toil, to separate husband and wife, and to sell little children at the auction block — then, sir, the chivalric senator will conduct the State of South Carolina out of the Union! [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] Heroic knight! Exalted senator! A Second Moses come for a second exodus! [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃]


But not content with this poor menace, which we have been twice told was "measured," the senator, in the unrestrained chivalry of his nature, has undertaken to apply opprobrious words to those who differ from him on this floor. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] He calls them "sectional and fanatical;" and opposition to the usurpation in Kansas, he denounces as "an uncalculating fanaticism." [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] To be sure, these charges lack all grace of originality, all sentiment of truth; but the adventurous senator does not hesitate. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] He is the uncompromising, unblushing representative on this floor of a flagrant sectionalism, which now domineers over the Republic, and yet with a ludicrous ignorance of his own position — unable to see himself as others see him — or with an effrontery which even his white head ought not protect from rebuke, he applies to those here who resist his sectionalism, the very epithet which designates himself. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] The men who strive to bring back the government to its original policy, when freedom and not slavery was national, while slavery and not freedom was sectional, he arraigns as sectional. [Contrasts and Juxtaposition 🔗] This will not do. It involves too great a perversion of terms. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] I tell that senator, that it is to himself, and to the "organization" of which he is the "committed advocate," that this epithet belongs. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] I now fasten it upon him. For myself, I care little for names; but since the question has been raised here, I affirm that the Republican party of the Union is in no just sense sectional, but, more than any other party, national; and that it now goes forth to dislodge from the high places of the government the tyrannical sectionalism of which the senator from South Carolina is one of the maddest zealots. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭]
To the charge of fanaticism I also reply. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Sir, fanaticism is found in an enthusiasm or exaggeration of opinions, particularly on religious subjects; but there may be a fanaticism for evil as well as good. [Contrasts and Juxtaposition 🔗] Now, I will not deny, that there are persons among us loving liberty too well for their personal good, in a selfish generation. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] Such there may be, and, for the sake of their example, would that there were more! [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] In calling them "fanatics," you cast contumely upon the noble army of martyrs, from the earliest day down to this hour; upon the great tribunes of human rights, by whom life, liberty, and happiness, on earth, have been secured; upon the long line of devoted patriots who, throughout history, have truly loved their country; and upon all who, in noble aspirations for the general good and in forgetfulness of self, have stood out before their age, and gathered into their generous bosoms the shafts of tyranny and wrong, in order to make a pathway for truth. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] You discredit Luther, when alone he nailed his articles to the door of the church at Wittenberg, and then, to the imperial demand that he should retract, firmly replied, "Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God!" [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] You discredit Hampden, when alone he refused to pay the few shillings of ship-money, and shook the throne of Charles I; you discredit Milton, when, amidst the corruptions of a heartless court, he lived on, the lofty friend of liberty, above question or suspicion; you discredit Russell and Sidney, when, for the sake of their country, they calmly turned from family and friends, to tread the narrow steps of the scaffold; you discredit those early founders of American institutions, who preferred the hardships of a wilderness, surrounded by a savage foe, to injustice on beds of ease; you discredit our later fathers, who, few in numbers and weak in resources, yet strong in their cause, did not hesitate to brave the mighty power of England, already encircling the globe with her morning drum-beats. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] Yes, sir, of such are the fanatics of history, according to the senator. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] But I tell that senator, that there are characters badly eminent, of whose fanaticism there can be no question. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Such were the ancient Egyptians, who worshipped divinities in brutish forms; the Druids, who darkened the forests of oak, in which they lived, by sacrifices of blood; the Mexicans, who surrendered countless victims to the propitiation of their obscene idols; the Spaniards, who under Alva, sought to force the inquisition upon Holland, by a tyranny kindred to that now employed to force Slavery upon Kansas; and such were the Algerines, when in solemn conclave, after listening to a speech not unlike that of the senator from South Carolina, they resolved to continue the slavery of white Christians, and to extend it to the countrymen of Washington. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] Aye, sir, extend it! [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] And in this same dreary catalogue faithful history must record all who now, in an enlightened age and in a land of boasted Freedom, stand up, in perversion of the constitution and in denial of immortal truth, to fasten a new shackle upon their fellow-man. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] If the senator wishes to see fanatics, let him look around among his own associates; let him look at himself. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃]

Here’s the tagged analysis of the provided excerpt from Charles Sumner’s speech:

---

But I have not done with the senator. There is another matter regarded by him of such consequence, that he interpolated it into the speech of the senator from New Hampshire, (Mr. Hale), and also announced that he had prepared himself with it, to take into his pocket all the way to Boston, when he expected to address the people of that community. On this account, and for the sake of truth, I stop for one moment, and tread it to the earth. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] The North, according to the senator, was engaged in the slave trade, and helped to introduce slaves into the southern States; and this undeniable fact he proposed to establish by statistics, in stating which his errors surpassed his sentences in number. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] But I let these pass for the present, that I may deal with his argument. Pray, sir, is the acknowledged turpitude of a departed generation to become an example for us? [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] And yet the suggestion of the senator if entitled to any consideration in this discussion, must have this extent. I join my friend from New Hampshire in thanking the senator from South Carolina for adducing this instance; for it gives me an opportunity to say, that the northern merchants, with homes in Boston, Bristol, Newport, New York, and Philadelphia, who catered for slavery during the years of the slave trade, are the lineal progenitors of the northern men, with homes in these places, who lend themselves to slavery in our day; [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] and especially that all, whether North or South, who take part, directly or indirectly, in the conspiracy against Kansas, do but continue the work of the slave-traders, which you condemn. [Contrasts and Juxtaposition 🔗] It is true, too true, alas! that our fathers were engaged in this traffic; but that is no apology for it. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] And in repelling the authority of this example, I repel also the trite argument founded on the earlier example of England. It is true that our mother country, at the peace of Utrecht, extorted from Spain the Asiento Contract, securing the monopoly of the slave trade with the Spanish colonies, as the whole price of all the blood of great victories; [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] that she niggled at Aix-la Chapelle for another lease of this exclusive traffic; and again, at the treaty of Madrid, clung to the wretched piracy. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] It is true, that in this spirit the power of the mother country was prostituted to the same base ends in her American colonies, against indignant protests from our fathers. All these things now rise up in judgment against her. Let us not follow the senator from South Carolina to do this very evil to-day, which in another generation we condemn. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃]

As the senator from South Carolina is the Don Quixote, [Metaphorical Language 🌐] the senator from Illinois (Mr. DOUGLAS) is the squire of slavery, its very Sancho Panza, ready to do all its humiliating offices. [Metaphorical Language 🌐] This senator, in his labored address, vindicating his labored report — piling one mass of elaborate error upon another mass — constrained himself, as you will remember, to unfamiliar, decencies of speech. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Of that address I have nothing to say at this moment, though before I sit down I shall show something of its fallacies. [Repetition for Emphasis 🔁] But I go back now to an earlier occasion, when, true to his native impulses, he threw into this discussion, "for a charm of powerful trouble," [Imagery and Descriptive Language 🎨] personalities most discreditable to this body. I will not stop to repel the imputations which he cast upon myself; but I mention them to remind you of the "sweltered venom sleeping got," [Imagery and Descriptive Language 🎨] which, with other poisoned ingredients, he cast into the caldron of this debate. [Metaphorical Language 🌐] Of other things I speak. Standing on this floor, the senator issued his rescript, requiring submission to the usurped power of Kansas; and this was accompanied by a manner — all his own — such as befits the tyrannical threat. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Very well. Let the senator try. I tell him now that he cannot enforce any such submission. The senator, with the slave power at his back, is strong; but he is not strong enough for this purpose. [Contrasts and Juxtaposition 🔗] He is bold. He shrinks from nothing. Like Danton, he may cry, "L'audace ! L'audace ! toujours L'audace !" [Foreign Phrase 🌐] but even his audacity cannot compass this work. The senator copies the British officer, who, with boastful swagger, said that with the hilt of his sword he would cram the "stamps" down the throats of the American people, and he will meet a similar failure. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] He may convulse this country with civil feud. Like the ancient madman, he may set fire to this temple of constitutional liberty, grander than Ephesian dome, [Metaphorical Language 🌐] but he cannot enforce obedience to that tyrannical usurpation. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫]

The senator dreams that he can subdue the North. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] He disclaims the open threat, but his conduct still implies it. How little that senator knows himself, or the strength of the cause which he persecutes! [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] He is but a mortal man; against him is an immortal principle. [Contrasts and Juxtaposition 🔗] With finite power he wrestles with the infinite, and he must fall. Against him are stronger battalions than any marshaled by mortal man — the inborn, ineradicable, invincible sentiments of the human heart; [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] against him is nature in all her subtle forces; against him is God. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] Let him try to subdue these.

But I pass from these things, which, though belonging to the very heart of the discussion, are yet preliminary in character, and press at once to the main question. [Repetition for Emphasis 🔁]



It belongs to me now, in the first place, to expose the CRIME AGAINST KANSAS, in its origin and extent. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Logically, this is the beginning of the argument. I say crime, and deliberately adopt this strongest term, as better than any other denoting the consummate transgression. I would go further, if language could further go. It is the crime of crimes — surpassing far the old crimen majestatis, pursued with vengeance by the laws of Rome, and containing all other crimes, as the greater contains the less. [Hyperbole for Effect 💬] I do not go too far, when I call it the crime against nature, from which the soul recoils, and which language refuses to describe. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] To lay bare this enormity, I now proceed. The whole subject has already become a twice-told tale, and its renewed recital will be a renewal of its sorrow and shame; but I shall not hesitate to enter upon it. The occasion requires it from the beginning.


It has been well remarked by a distinguished historian of our country, that, at the Ithuriel touch of the Missouri discussion, the slave interest, hitherto hardly recognised as a distinct element in our system, started up portentous and dilated, with threats and assumptions, which are the origin of our existing national politics. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] That was in 1820. The discussion ended with the admission of Missouri as a slaveholding State, and the prohibition of slavery in all the remaining territory west of the Mississippi, and north of 36 deg. 30 min., leaving the condition of other territory south of this line, or subsequently acquired, untouched by the arrangement. [Contrasts and Juxtaposition 🔗] Here was a solemn act of legislation, called at the time a compromise, a covenant, a compact, first brought forward in this body by a slaveholder — vindicated by slaveholders in debates — finally sanctioned by slaveholding votes — also upheld at the time by the essential approbation of a slaveholding President, James Monroe, and his cabinet, of whom a majority were slaveholders, including Mr. Calhoun himself; [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] and this compromise was made the condition of the admission of Missouri, without which that State could not have been received into the Union. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] The bargain was simple, and was applicable, of course, only to the territory named. Leaving all other territory to await the judgment of another generation, the South said to the North, Conquer your prejudices so far as to admit Missouri as a slave State, and, in consideration of this much-coveted boon, slavery shall be prohibited forever in all the remaining Louisiana Territory above 36 deg. 30 min.; and the North yielded. [Diction and Language Choices 📝]

In total disregard of history, the President, in his annual message, has told us that this compromise "was reluctantly acquiesced in by the Southern States." [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Just the contrary is true. It was the work of slaveholders, and was crowded by their concurring votes upon a reluctant North. [Contrasts and Juxtaposition 🔗] At the time it was hailed by slaveholders as a victory. Charles Pinckney, of South Carolina, in an oft-quoted letter, written at three o'clock on the night of its passage, says, "It is considered here by the slaveholding States as a great triumph." [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] At the north it was accepted as a defeat, and the friends of Freedom everywhere throughout the country bowed their heads with mortification. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] But little did they know the completeness of their disaster. Little did they dream that the prohibition of slavery in the Territory, which was stipulated as the price of their total capitulation, would also at the very moment of its maturity be wrested from them. [Diction and Language Choices 📝]
Time passed, and it became necessary to provide for this Territory an organized government. Suddenly, without notice in the public press, or the prayer of a single petition, or one word of open recommendation from the President — after an acquiescence of thirty-three years, and the irreclaimable possession by the South of its special share under this compromise — in violation of every obligation of honor, compact, and good neighborhood — and in contemptuous disregard of the out-gushing sentiments of an aroused North, this time-honored prohibition, in itself a landmark of Freedom, was overturned, and the vast region now known as Kansas and Nebraska was opened to slavery. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] [Metaphorical Language 🌐]** It was natural that a measure thus repugnant in character should be pressed by arguments mutually repugnant. It was urged on two principal reasons, so opposite and inconsistent as to slap each other in the face—one being that, by the repeal of the prohibition, the Territory would be left open to the entry of slaveholders with their slaves, without hindrance; and the other being, that the people would be left absolutely free to determine the question for themselves, and to prohibit the entry of slaveholders with their slaves, if they should think best. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] With some, the apology was the alleged rights of slaveholders; with others, it was the alleged rights of the people — with some it was openly the extension of slavery; and with others it was openly the establishment of freedom, under the guise of popular sovereignty. [Contrasts and Juxtaposition 🔗] Of course, the measure, thus upheld in defiance of reason, was carried through Congress in defiance of all the securities of legislation; and I mention these things that you may see in what foulness the present crime was engendered. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] [Metaphorical Language 🌐]
It was carried, first, by whipping in to its support, through executive influence and patronage, men who acted against their own declared judgment and the known will of their constituents. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Secondly, by foisting out of place, both in the Senate and the House of Representatives, important business, long pending, and usurping its room. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Thirdly, by trampling under foot the rules of the House of Representatives, always before the safeguard of the minority. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] And fourthly, by driving it to a close during the very session in which it originated, so that it might not be arrested by the indignant voice of the People. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] Such are some of the means by which this snap judgment was obtained. If the clear will of the people had not been disregarded, it would not have passed. If the government had not nefariously interposed its influence, it could not have passed. If it had been left to its natural place in the order of business, it could not have passed. If the rules of the House and the rights of the minority had not been violated, it could not have passed. [Repetition for Emphasis 🔁] If it had been allowed to go over to another Congress, when the people might be heard, it would have been ended; and then the crime we now deplore, would have been without its first seminal life. [Diction and Language Choices 📝]



Mr. President, I mean to keep absolutely within the limits of parliamentary propriety. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] I make no personal imputations; but only with frankness, such as belongs to the occasion and my own character, describe a great historical act, which is now enrolled in the Capitol. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Sir, the Nebraska bill was in every respect a swindle. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] It was a swindle by the South of the North. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] It was, one the part of those who had already completely enjoyed their share of the Missouri Compromise, a swindle of these whose share was yet absolutely untouched; and the plea of unconstitutionality set up — like the plea of usury after the borrowed money has been enjoyed — did not make it less a swindle. [Metaphorical Language 🌐] Urged as a bill of peace, it was a swindle of the whole country. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Urged as opening the doors to slave-masters with their slaves, it was a swindle of the asserted doctrine of popular sovereignty. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Urged as sanctioning popular sovereignty, it was a swindle of the asserted rights of slave-masters. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] It was a swindle of a broad territory, thus cheated of protection against slavery. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] It was a swindle of a great cause, early espoused by Washington, Franklin, and Jefferson, surrounded by the best fathers of the republic. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] Sir, it was a swindle of God-given inalienable rights. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] Turn it over; look at it on all sides, and it is everywhere a swindle; and, if the word I now employ has not the authority of classical usage, it has, on this occasion, the indubitable authority of fitness. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] No other word will adequately express the mingled meanness and wickedness of the cheat. [Diction and Language Choices 📝]


Its character was still further apparent in the general structure of the bill. Amidst overflowing professions of regard for the sovereignty of the people in the Territory, they were despoiled of every essential privilege of sovereignty. [Contrasts and Juxtaposition 🔗] They were not allowed to choose their Governor, Secretary, chief justice, associate justices, attorney, or marshal — all of whom are sent from Washington; nor were they allowed to regulate the salaries of any of these functionaries, or the daily allowance of the legislative body, or even the pay of the clerks and door-keepers; but they were left free to adopt slavery. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] And this was called popular sovereignty! [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] Time does not allow, nor does the occasion require, that I should stop to dwell on this transparent device to cover a transcendent wrong. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Suffice it to say, that slavery is in itself an arrogant denial of human rights, and by no human reason can the power to establish such a wrong be placed among the attributes of any just sovereignty. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] In refusing it such a place, I do not deny popular rights, but uphold them; I do not restrain popular rights, but extend them. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] And, sir, to this conclusion you must yet come, unless deaf, not only to the admonitions of political justice, but also to the genius of our own constitution, under which, when properly interpreted, no valid claim for slavery can be set up anywhere in the national territory. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] The senator from Michigan (Mr. CASS) may say, in response to the senator from Mississippi, (Mr. BROWN) that slavery cannot go into the territory under the Constitution, without legislative introduction; and permit me to add, in response to both, that slavery cannot go there at all. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Nothing can come out of nothing; and there is absolutely nothing in the constitution out of which slavery can be derived, while there are provisions, which, when properly interpreted, make its existence anywhere within the exclusive national jurisdiction impossible. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭]
The offensive provision in the bill was, in its form, a legislative anomaly, utterly wanting the natural directness and simplicity of an honest transaction. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] It did not undertake openly to repeal the old prohibition of slavery, but seemed to mince the matter, as if conscious of the swindle. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] It is said that this prohibition, "being inconsistent with the principle of non-intervention by Congress with slavery in the States and territories, as recognised by the legislation of 1850, commonly called the compromise measures, is hereby declared inoperative and void." [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Thus, with insidious ostentation, was it pretended that an act, violating the greatest compromise of our legislative history, and setting loose the foundations of all compromise, was derived out of a compromise. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] Then followed in the bill the further declaration, which is entirely without precedent, and which has been aptly called "a stump speech in its belly," namely: "it being the true intent and meaning of this act, not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefore, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the constitution of the United States." [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Here were smooth words, such as belong to a cunning tongue enlisted in a bad cause. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] But whatever may have been their various hidden meanings, this at least was evident, that, by their effect, the congressional prohibition of slavery, which had always been regarded as a seven-fold shield, covering the whole Louisiana Territory north of 36 deg. 30', was now removed, while a principle was declared, which would render the supplementary prohibition of slavery in Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington, "inoperative and void," and thus open to slavery all these vast regions, now the rude cradles of mighty states. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] Here you see the magnitude of the mischief contemplated. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] But my purpose now is with the crime against Kansas, and I shall not stop to expose the conspiracy beyond. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] 


Mr. President, men are wisely presumed to intend the natural consequences of their conduct, and to seek what their acts seem to promote. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] Now, the Nebraska bill, on its very face, openly cleared the way for slavery, and it is not wrong to presume that its originators intended the natural consequences of such an act, and sought in this way to extend slavery. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Of course, they did. And this is the first stage in the Crime against Kansas. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫]
But this was speedily followed by other developments. The bare-faced scheme was soon whispered that Kansas must be a slave State. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] In conformity with this idea was the Government of this unhappy Territory organized in all its departments; and thus did the President, by whose complicity the prohibition of slavery had been overthrown, lend himself to a new complicity—giving to the conspirators a lease of connivance, amounting even to copartnership. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] The governor, secretary, chief justice, associate justices, attorney, and marshal, with a whole caucus of other stipendaries, nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, were all commended as friendly to Slavery. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] No man with the sentiments of Washington, or Jefferson, or Franklin, found any favor; [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] nor is it too much to say, that had these great patriots once more come among us, not one of them, with his recorded unretracted opinions on slavery, could have been nominated by the President or confirmed by the Senate for any post in that Territory. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] With such auspices the conspiracy proceeded. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Even in advance of the Nebraska bill, secret societies were organized in Missouri ostensibly to protect her institutions; and afterwards, under the name of "Self-Defensive Associations," and of "Blue Lodges," these were multiplied throughout the western counties of that State; before any counter movement from the North. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] It was confidently anticipated, that, by the activity of these societies, and the interest of slaveholders everywhere, with the advantage derived from the neighborhood of Missouri, and the influence of the Territorial government, slavery might be introduced into Kansas, quietly but surely, without arousing a conflict—that the crocodile egg might be stealthily dropped in the sun-burnt soil, there to be hatched, unobserved until it sent forth its reptile monster. [Metaphorical Language 🌐]
But the conspiracy was unexpectedly balked. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] The debate, which convulsed Congress, had stirred the whole country. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] Attention from all sides was directed upon Kansas, which at once became the favorite goal of emigration. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] The bill had loudly declared that its object was "to leave the people perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way;" [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] and its supporters everywhere challenged the determination of the question between freedom and slavery by a competition of emigration. [Contrasts and Juxtaposition 🔗] Thus, while opening the Territory to slavery, the bill also opened it to emigrants from every quarter, who might by their votes redress the wrong. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] The populous North, stung by a sharp sense of outrage, and inspired by a noble cause, poured into the debatable land, and promised soon to establish a supremacy of numbers there, involving, of course, a just supremacy of freedom. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] 


The Crime Against Kansas," using the full list of tags you provided: Then was conceived the consummation of the crime against Kansas. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] What could not be accomplished peaceably was to be accomplished forcibly. [Contrasts and Juxtaposition 🔗] The reptile monster, that could not be quietly and securely hatched there, was to be pushed full-grown into the Territory. [Metaphorical Language 🌐] All efforts were now given to the dismal work of forcing slavery on free soil. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] In flagrant derogation of the very popular sovereignty, whose name helped to impose this bill upon the country, the atrocious object was now distinctly avowed. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] And the avowal has been followed by the act. Slavery has been forcibly introduced into Kansas, and placed under the formal safeguards of pretended law. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] How this was done, belongs to the argument.
In depicting this consummation, the simplest outline, without one word of color, will be best. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Whether regarded in its mass or its details, in its origin or its result, it is all blackness, illumined by nothing from itself, but only by the heroism of the undaunted men and women, whom it environed. [Imagery and Descriptive Language 🎨] A plain statement of facts will be a picture of fearful truth, which faithful history will preserve in its darkest gallery. [Metaphorical Language 🌐] In the foreground all will recognise a familiar character, in himself a connecting link between the President and the border ruffian — less conspicuous for ability than for the exalted place he has occupied — who once sat in the seat where you now sit, sir; where once sat John Adams and Thomas Jefferson; also, where once sat Aaron Burr. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] I need not add the name of David R. Atchison. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] You have not forgotten that, at the session of Congress immediately succeeding the Nebraska bill, he came tardily to his duty here, and then, after a short time, disappeared. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] The secret has been long since disclosed. Like Catiline, he stalked into this Chamber, reeking with conspiracy — immo in seniatum venit — and then like Catiline he skulked away — abiit, excessit, evasit, crupit — to join and provoke the conspirators, who at a distance awaited their congenial chief. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] Under the influence of his malign presence the crime ripened to its fatal fruits, while the similitude with Catiline was again renewed in the sympathy, not even concealed, which he found in the very Senate itself, where, beyond even the Roman example, a senator has not hesitated to appear as his open compurgator. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️]
And now, as I proceed to show the way in which this Territory was overrun and finally subjugated to slavery, I desire to remove in advance all question with regard to the authority on which I rely. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] The evidence is secondary; but it is the best which, in the nature of the case; can be had, and it is not less clear, direct, and peremptory, than any by which we are assured of the campaigns in the Crimea or the fall of Sebastopol. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] In its manifold mass, I confidently assert, that it is such a body of evidence as the human mind is not able to resist. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] It is found in the concurring reports of the public press; in the letters of correspondents; in the testimony of travellers; and in the unaffected story to which I have listened from leading citizens, who, during this winter, have "come flocking" here from that distant Territory. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] It breaks forth in the irrepressible outcry, reaching us from Kansas, in truthful tones, which leave no ground of mistake. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] It addresses us in formal complaints, instinct with the indignation of a people determined to be free, and unimpeachable as the declarations of a murdered man on his dying bed against his murderer. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] And let me add, that all this testimony finds an echo in the very book of the conspirators, and also in the language dropped from — the President of the United States.
