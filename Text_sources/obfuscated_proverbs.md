This text is a high-satire Victorian-style parody of moralistic instruction, dressing well-known English proverbs in overwrought Latinate diction and faux-scholarly tone. Each stanza rephrases a common proverb in absurdly elaborate and archaic language — the pomp is the point.

Below is a **literal decoding** of each line/stanza into the actual proverb it's referring to:

---

### 1.

> **"OBSERVE yon plumèd biped fine ! To effect his captivation , Deposit particles saline Upon his termination ."**
> ⟶ **"To catch a bird, put salt on its tail."**
> A humorous old folk saying implying that catching a bird is easy if you can get close enough to salt its tail — which, of course, is impossible. Often said to mock naive plans.

---

### 2.

> **"Cryptogamous concretion never grows On mineral fragments that decline repose ."**
> ⟶ **"A rolling stone gathers no moss."**
> A cryptogam is a non-flowering plant like moss or algae; concretion = accumulation. A rolling (i.e., never-stationary) stone doesn’t allow moss to grow.

---

### 3.

> **"Whilst self - inspection it neglects , Nor its own foul condition sees , The kettle to the pot objects Its sordid superficies ."**
> ⟶ **"The pot calls the kettle black."**
> Classic hypocrisy proverb: criticizing someone for a fault one also has.

---

### 4.

> **"Decortications of the golden grain Are set to allure the agèd fowl , in vain ."**
> ⟶ **"You can't teach an old bird with chaff."**
> Meaning: you can’t fool an experienced person with something useless or deceptive. *Chaff* = husks separated from grain.

---

### 5.

> **"Teach not a parent's mother to extract The embryo juices of an egg by suction ; That good old lady can the feat enact Quite irrespective of your kind instruction ."**
> ⟶ **"Don’t teach your grandmother to suck eggs."**
> Archaic proverb meaning: Don’t presume to instruct someone more experienced than you, especially in what they already know.

---

### 6.

> **"Pecuniary agencies have force To stimulate to speed the female horse ."**
> ⟶ **"Money makes the mare go."**
> A blunt observation on the motivational power of money.

---

### 7.

> **"The earliest winged songster soonest sees , And first appropriates , the annelides ."**
> ⟶ **"The early bird catches the worm."**
> Literal: Annelides = worms; early birds eat first.

---

### 8.

> **"With soap , and brush , and flannel , you tickle In vain , the Ethiopic cuticle ."**
> ⟶ **"You can't wash the blackamoor white."**
> This is a now-offensive proverb, rooted in racist colonial assumptions. It originally meant “you can't change a person’s nature,” but reflects an attempt to moralize over immutable physical difference, in language that’s both dehumanizing and supremacist.

---

### Final Observation:

Each reworded proverb mocks both pedantry and moralizing piety. The **form mimics high-society erudition**; the **content reveals crude peasant wisdom**, some now obsolete or morally bankrupt. It’s a send-up of Victorian propriety, hinting at the futility of dressing base truisms in elite garb — like polishing vulgarity with Latin.
