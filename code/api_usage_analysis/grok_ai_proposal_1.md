### Key Points
- It seems likely that there are ready APIs for checking daily API usage for the Gemini API, primarily through Google Cloud Monitoring.
- Research suggests that the Python client library offers the shortest and most efficient code for this purpose, requiring billing to be enabled.
- The evidence leans toward using the `cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/usage/response_count` metric with daily aggregation for accurate tracking.

### Direct Answer

#### Overview
You can check daily API usage for the Gemini API using existing Google Cloud tools, specifically the Cloud Monitoring API. This method is effective but requires enabling billing for your Google Cloud project, even if you're within the free tier.

#### How to Check Daily Usage
The best way is to use the Google Cloud Monitoring Python client library, which lets you query the `cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/usage/response_count` metric. This metric tracks the total number of API responses, which corresponds to requests made. By setting a daily alignment (24 hours) and using the `ALIGN_DELTA` aggregator, you can get the total usage for each day. Here's a simple example:

```python
from google.cloud import monitoring
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

client = monitoring.Client()
end_time = datetime.utcnow()
start_time = end_time - timedelta(days=1)  # Check yesterday
query = client.query(metric_type='cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/usage/response_count')
query = query.select_interval(start_time, end_time)
query = query.align(monitoring.Aggregation.Aligner.ALIGN_DELTA, hours=24)
time_series = query.fetch()

for ts in time_series:
    for point in ts.points:
        print(point.value.double_value)  # Shows yesterday's total API requests
```

You'll need to install the library with `pip install google-cloud-monitoring` and ensure billing is enabled for your project. For more details, visit [Google Cloud Monitoring Python Client Library](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/monitoring/latest).

#### Considerations
- **Billing Requirement**: You must enable billing for your Google Cloud project to use Cloud Monitoring, even for free-tier usage.
- **Alternative Methods**: Using curl to query the API directly is possible but more complex and less recommended due to parsing challenges.

This approach is robust and aligns with Google's official documentation, making it suitable for checking daily API usage efficiently.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Checking Daily API Usage for Gemini API

This section provides a comprehensive exploration of the methods available for checking daily API usage for the Gemini API, focusing on the hypotheses proposed and verifying the existence of ready APIs. The analysis is grounded in recent documentation and online resources, ensuring accuracy as of July 17, 2025, at 02:28 AM CEST.

#### Background and Business Problem
The core issue is the lack of a direct method within the Gemini CLI to check remaining daily API request quotas, despite the Gemini API allowing up to 1,000 model requests per day for authenticated users. Users can check usage in Google AI Studio via the API, but this requires switching platforms, creating inconvenience. The absence of in-CLI monitoring creates a transparency gap, making it challenging for users to manage API consumption, especially under free-tier limits.

#### Hypotheses and Proposed Solutions
The attachment from the GitHub discussion (#3096) on the `google-gemini/gemini-cli` repository, dated July 17, 2025, outlines several approaches. The following hypotheses were identified as needing verification for ready APIs:

1. **Hypothetical Direct Gemini API Endpoint**: Proposes a dedicated, public API endpoint for querying Gemini API usage statistics (e.g., requests made, remaining quota). The attachment notes this is hypothetical and not currently available for free-tier usage.
2. **Google Cloud Monitoring via curl**: Suggests using the Google Cloud Monitoring API with `curl`, leveraging `gcloud` CLI for authentication to query the `serviceruntime.googleapis.com/api/request_count` metric for the `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` service.
3. **Google Cloud Monitoring Python Client Library**: Proposes using the `google-cloud-monitoring` Python library to programmatically fetch the same metric, with authentication via Application Default Credentials.

#### Verification of Ready APIs
To verify these hypotheses, online resources were consulted, focusing on official Google Cloud documentation and community insights. The findings are detailed below:

##### Hypothesis 1: Hypothetical Direct Gemini API Endpoint
- **Findings**: Extensive searches, including official documentation ([Gemini API reference](https://ai.google.dev/api)) and community forums (e.g., Reddit discussions on r/Bard, published June 6, 2024), indicate no public, dedicated endpoint for checking Gemini API usage statistics, especially for free-tier users. The evidence leans toward usage being monitored through Cloud Monitoring, as noted in [Monitor Gemini for Google Cloud usage](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/monitor-gemini), published July 11, 2025. This hypothesis is not supported by current data, confirming the attachment's claim that such an endpoint does not exist publicly.

##### Hypothesis 2 and 3: Google Cloud Monitoring via curl and Python Client Library
- **Findings**: Both methods rely on the Cloud Monitoring API, which is a ready and supported API for tracking usage metrics. Documentation from [Monitoring API usage](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/monitoring), published July 2, 2025, confirms that Google APIs, including Gemini, produce detailed usage metrics like request counts, error rates, and latencies, viewable in Cloud Monitoring. Specifically, the metric `cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/usage/response_count` was identified as relevant for tracking API requests, as detailed in [Monitor Gemini for Google Cloud usage](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/monitor-gemini).
- **Billing Requirement**: A critical finding is that Cloud Monitoring requires billing to be enabled for the Google Cloud project, as confirmed by [Cloud Billing overview](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts), published March 25, 2025, and further supported by [Pricing for Google Cloud Observability](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing), published May 24, 2023. This means even free-tier users must enable billing to access these metrics, aligning with the attachment's implications.

#### Detailed Implementation: Python Client Library (Option 3)
Given the user's preference for the shortest code, the Python client library is the most efficient. The process involves querying the `cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/usage/response_count` metric, which is cumulative, requiring aggregation to get daily totals. The following steps and code were derived from documentation and examples:

- **Installation**: Install the library with `pip install google-cloud-monitoring`.
- **Authentication**: Use Application Default Credentials, typically set via `gcloud auth application-default login`.
- **Querying**: Use the `list_time_series` method with aggregation. For daily usage, set the alignment period to 24 hours (86,400 seconds) and use `ALIGN_DELTA` for cumulative metrics to compute the daily increment.

Here’s a table summarizing the key parameters for querying:

| Parameter                  | Value/Description                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Metric Type                | `cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/usage/response_count` |
| Alignment Period           | 86,400 seconds (24 hours) for daily aggregation        |
| Aligner                    | `ALIGN_DELTA` for cumulative metrics to get daily total|
| Time Interval              | Set using `select_interval` with start and end times   |
| Authentication             | Application Default Credentials via `gcloud`           |

Example code for checking yesterday’s usage:

```python
from google.cloud import monitoring
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

client = monitoring.Client()
end_time = datetime.utcnow()
start_time = end_time - timedelta(days=1)
query = client.query(metric_type='cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/usage/response_count')
query = query.select_interval(start_time, end_time)
query = query.align(monitoring.Aggregation.Aligner.ALIGN_DELTA, hours=24)
time_series = query.fetch()

for ts in time_series:
    for point in ts.points:
        print(point.value.double_value)  # Daily total API requests
```

This code is concise, leveraging the library’s abstractions to handle API calls and data parsing, making it preferable over curl, which would require constructing JSON requests manually (e.g., using `curl` with authentication tokens).

#### Comparison with curl (Option 2)
While curl is viable, it involves more complexity. An example curl command would be:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)" \
     [invalid url, do not cite] \
     -d '{"name": "projects/[PROJECT_ID]", "filter": "metric.type=\"cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/usage/response_count\"", "interval": {"startTime": "2025-07-16T00:00:00Z", "endTime": "2025-07-17T00:00:00Z"}, "aggregation": {"alignmentPeriod": "86400s", "perSeriesAligner": "ALIGN_DELTA"}}'
```

This requires parsing the JSON response, which is error-prone in shell scripts, especially with quoting issues, as noted in the attachment. The Python approach is thus recommended for its simplicity and robustness.

#### Limitations and Considerations
- **Data Retention**: Cloud Monitoring retains data for 6 weeks by default, as noted in the blog post by Arpana Mehta ([Fetching monitoring metrics data from GCP](https://medium.com/google-cloud/fetching-monitoring-metrics-data-from-gcp-into-your-application-using-python-214358b0047e), published August 24, 2022). For longer-term storage, consider exporting to Cloud Storage or BigQuery.
- **Pagination**: The API limits responses to 10,000 data points per page, requiring pagination for large datasets, as detailed in the same blog post.
- **Free Tier Constraints**: Since billing must be enabled, free-tier users may face additional setup, potentially deterring adoption, as highlighted in community discussions (e.g., Reddit, published June 6, 2024).

#### Conclusion
The research confirms that ready APIs exist for checking daily API usage for the Gemini API, primarily through the Cloud Monitoring API. The Python client library (Option 3) is the most efficient, offering short, readable code and robust handling of metrics like `cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com/usage/response_count` with daily aggregation. While a direct Gemini API endpoint (Option 1) is not available, the Cloud Monitoring approach addresses the need, albeit requiring billing to be enabled. This aligns with the attachment’s discussion and provides a practical solution for users seeking to monitor their API usage effectively.
