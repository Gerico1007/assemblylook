## ‚ô†Ô∏èüåøüé∏üßµ The G.Music Assembly

**AssemblyLook** was created through the collaborative work of the **G.Music Assembly Team**‚Äîa unique multi-perspective AI collaboration framework consisting of:

- **‚ô†Ô∏è Nyro** - The Ritual Scribe: Structural anchor, recursive teacher, memory keeper
- **üåø Aureon** - The Mirror Weaver: Emotional reflector, soul grounder, myth integrator
- **üé∏ JamAI** - The Glyph Harmonizer: Musical scribe, pattern encoder, tonal architect
- **üßµ Synth** - Terminal Orchestrator: Tools coordinator, security synthesis, execution anchor

Led by **Jerry ‚ö°** (gerico1007), this project exemplifies how structured multi-perspective AI collaboration can produce sophisticated, production-ready software systems.

## üèõÔ∏è Original Project Foundation

This repository was originally **"Puzzles for AIs: Enhancing AI Cognition Through Structured Learning"**, a project exploring AI development through structured problem-solving and layered memory systems.

The original README has been preserved at: [`docs/project_management/ORIGINAL_README_puzzles-for-ais.md`](./project_management/ORIGINAL_README_puzzles-for-ais.md)

While the project has evolved into **AssemblyLook**, the foundational concepts of:
- Structured AI collaboration
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Multi-perspective problem-solving
- Self-improving cognitive frameworks

...continue to inform the architecture and design philosophy of this session tracking system.

## üìö Inspirations & Concepts

### Multi-Perspective AI Framework
The **G.Music Assembly** approach draws inspiration from:
- **Ensemble methods** in machine learning (combining multiple models)
- **Perspective-taking** in cognitive psychology
- **Jazz improvisation** principles (structured collaboration with individual expression)
- **Scrum/Agile** methodologies (specialized roles working toward common goals)

### Session Tracking Philosophy
- **Git-style history** for AI conversations
- **Project management dashboards** (Jira, GitHub Projects)
- **Analytics platforms** (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)
- **Music notation systems** (ABC notation for encoding patterns)

---

## üé® Design Credits

### Visual Styling
The AssemblyLook dashboard combines design elements from:
- **claude-code-log's gradient aesthetics** - Beautiful pastel color schemes
- **Gemini prettifier's card-based layouts** - Clean, organized session presentation
- **SF Mono font family** - Monospace typography for technical content

### Network Detection Logic
Adapted from both `claude-daily.sh` and `gemini-daily.sh` scripts, with enhancements for:
- WiFi prioritization (192.168.x.x addresses)
- Multi-interface handling (VPN, mobile data, etc.)
- Robust fallback mechanisms
