# Project Documentation

This directory contains all documentation for the Puzzles_for_AIs project, organized into logical categories to enhance discoverability and understanding.

## Structure

*   **`code/` (Top-Level Directory):** Contains all project-specific code, including API usage analysis scripts and CLI log prettifiers.

*   **`docs/` (This Directory):** Houses all documentation.
    *   **`concepts/`:** For foundational, theoretical, or abstract ideas that explain *what* something is or *why* it works (e.g., AI collaboration frameworks, memory systems).
    *   **`brainstorm/`:** A dedicated space for unstructured thoughts, raw ideas, and miscellaneous notes.
    *   **`strategy/`:** For high-level strategic documents, visions, and analyses that guide the project's direction (e.g., life assistant vision, implications and risks).
    *   **`guides/`:** For practical, actionable guides, workflows, and best practices (e.g., Git/GitHub workflows, sequential thinking guides, API interaction guides).
