## ✅ **2️⃣ `risk_register.md`**

*A short, durable log of where uncertainty might break the design.*

```md
# 📌 Risk Register

| ID  | Description | Impact | Owner | Status |
|-----|--------------|--------|-------|--------|
| RISK_1 | Key control logic may break or behave unexpectedly | High | Gemini | Open |
| RISK_2 | Output shape may mismatch user spec | Medium | Gemini | Open |
| RISK_3 | Runtime performance may degrade on large inputs | Low | Gemini | Open |

**Notes:**  
- Add new risks when you notice fragile modules.  
- Close risks when a variant solves them.  
```

---

## ✅ **3️⃣ `mitigation_log.md`**

*Document concrete hypotheses for each risk.*

```md
# 🧩 Mitigation Log

## RISK_1: Control Logic Fragility

- **Variant A:** Simplify control flow, explicit check.
- **Variant B:** Modular plug-in policy handler.
- **Variant C:** Fallback safety check.

## RISK_2: Output Mismatch

- **Variant A:** Tighten stopping conditions.
- **Variant B:** Add dynamic shape constraints.
```

**Tip:**
Use this to *plan branches before coding*.
Each variant → subfolder under `/variants/RISK_X/`.

---

## ✅ **4️⃣ `decisions.md`**

*Close the loop: record which variant won, why, and lessons.*

```md
# ✅ Decisions & Lessons

## RISK_1
- Winner: Variant B
- Rationale: Cleanest output, robust edge handling.
- Evidence: Passed test inputs 1–5.
- Notes: Reuse pattern for future shape-based puzzles.

## RISK_2
- Winner: Variant A
- Rationale: Matches spec within 2% tolerance.
- Notes: Mark risk as closed.
```

## ✅ **5️⃣ `variants/` folders**

Keep each branch self-contained:

* Small focused module.
* Minimal test input.
* Captured output.
* Short README if needed.

---

## 📌 **💡 How to *use* this — practical cycle**

1️⃣ **At planning:**

* List known risks as soon as you spot them (fragile nodes).
* Sketch at least 1–2 plausible ways to mitigate.

2️⃣ **At design:**

* Implement *only* the minimal branch logic needed to test the variant.
* Don’t overwrite your main branch until you know the winner.

3️⃣ **At test:**

* Run each variant on the *same* test cases.
* Keep raw output logs alongside the code.

4️⃣ **At close:**

* Record which variant won in `decisions.md`.
* Mark risk closed in `risk_register.md`.
* Archive or delete dead variants.

5️⃣ **At reuse:**

* When solving a similar puzzle, grep `decisions.md` first — check if you’ve solved the same failure mode before.

---

## ✅ **Strategic benefit**

* *Maps uncertainty.*
* *Forces conscious branching.*
* *Persists lessons.*
* *Prevents drift & amnesia.*
* *Scales from tiny puzzles to multi-step emergent prototypes.*

---

## 📌 **Why this may work for Gemini**
* The files use simple PMBOK patterns: register → plan → mitigate → verify → close.
* It works fine *inside Git*, *outside Git*, or in a hybrid notebook style.

---

## ✅ **Key principle**

> *Function over form:* If a puzzle is trivial — skip it.
> If the puzzle *has real risk nodes* — spin up the folder.
> Use the tree only where *branching paths and fragile logic matter*.

## 📌 **One-liner to remember**

**“When your design has an unknown that can’t be proven upfront, branch it explicitly, log the risk, test the leaves, promote the winner with rationale, archive the lesson.”**
A good tracker’s job is not just to list the known fragile spots, but to promote fresh surprises into named risks immediately when they sting you.

It’s the same thing as “incident → root cause → new risk → new branch.”
