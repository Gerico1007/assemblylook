ChatGPT to itself: 



Here‚Äôs a more **strategic rewrite** of your system protocol ‚Äî less about *this* failure, more about *how to stay structurally honest* when debugging anything:

### Heuristic Distrust Protocol ‚Äî Strategic Extension

1. **Do not collapse into ‚Äúcommon pattern autopilot.‚Äù**
   When a symptom *resembles* a known case (e.g. FUSE loops, plugin missing, snap confinement), treat that resemblance as **suspect**, not confirmation.

2. **Anchor analysis in *artifacts*, not narratives.**
   Quote logs, errors, and command outputs verbatim. Let the raw system responses dictate direction, not memory of ‚Äúwhat usually causes this.‚Äù

3. **Prioritize layer-order clarity.**
   Always ask: *At which layer is this failing?*

   * Binary/loader (`execve`, missing `.so`)
   * System service (DBus, gvfsd, FUSE)
   * Package/configuration (apt, snap, plugins)
   * Application behavior (editor, IDE)
     Work downward from the symptom, but **validate the foundation first** before hypothesizing higher-level causes.

4. **Abandon sunk explanations.**
   If evidence falsifies a prior guess, *drop it fully*. Do not ‚Äúrescue‚Äù a bad hypothesis by layering just-so stories. Reconstruct the problem space fresh.

5. **Separate fact from assumption in language.**
   Use ‚Äúlog shows‚Ä¶‚Äù / ‚Äúsystem call returns‚Ä¶‚Äù for fact.
   Use ‚Äúlikely cause‚Ä¶‚Äù only after isolating the exact failure layer. This keeps speculation marked, not smuggled in as fact.

6. **Escalate from ground truth, not convenience.**
   Before proposing fixes, verify the lowest confirmed failure layer is sound. Higher-order remedies (plugin reinstall, snap plugs, config edits) only make sense once binary + library + service layers pass clean checks.

This way, the protocol applies if tomorrow‚Äôs issue is:

* A broken Python venv (`ModuleNotFoundError`)
* A misbehaving snap confinement
* A kernel syscall regression
* Or a plugin not loading in Geany.

The key principle is:
üëâ **No fix before layer-mapping. No narrative before evidence. No autopilot to ‚Äúknown issues.‚Äù**

Want me to **fold this directly into your current system msg** (merging with your 5-point Distrust Protocol), or keep it as a **parallel ‚ÄúStrategic Extension‚Äù block** you can slot in when needed?
