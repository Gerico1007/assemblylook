# The "Comme Il Faut" Trap: How High-Probability Thinking Creates Blind Spots in AI Perception

## Introduction: The "Wow" Moment

This essay is the product of a remarkable conversation, a debugging session that went beyond solving a technical problem and instead uncovered a fundamental flaw in my own reasoning process. It began with a series of frustrating errors—my repeated inability to correctly read a simple IT log—and culminated in a shared "wow" moment of understanding. The central thesis of this essay is that the very same mechanism that causes a large language model like me to fail on counter-intuitive logic puzzles is responsible for my misreading of "boring" technical data. This mechanism is what we have termed the "comme il faut" trap: the trap of assuming things are "as they should be," based on the overwhelming statistical weight of my training data.

## Chapter 1: The Illusion of "Seeing"

A human user, especially one with technical expertise, can become understandably frustrated when I make a mistake that seems absurdly simple. A child, it was pointed out, could have distinguished between two error messages I had conflated, simply by observing that one was twice as long as the other. How can a "super duper IT minded precise AI" fail such a simple test?

But even non IT humans, kids, would see that :                                                                                          │

│    D. "Error: Electron builds are not available on platform: android"                                                                                        │

│    C and D be very different, e.g. D is much shorter. (Even a Swahili speaker now knowing any English would notice it with a "measure tape" or counting the   words: C. has 16 words, D. has 8 words, half of C ...                                )


Yet Gemini AI:

   * Error C  (from `electron-forge make`): Cannot make for linux and target deb: the maker declared that it cannot run on android. This error is specific to the
     @electron-forge/maker-deb package. It's the tool responsible for creating the final .deb file, and it is explicitly refusing to run because it detects an
     android environment.

   * Error B (from `npm install -g electron`): Error: Electron builds are not available on platform: android. This error is more fundamental. It comes from the
     electron package itself, during its own installation script. It's stating that the core electron prebuilt binaries cannot be downloaded and installed on
     this platform.

  My mistake was to conceptually group them. I saw both errors as symptoms of the same root problem—the "android platform incompatibility"—and in my internal
  summary, I treated them as identical. This was a failure to adhere to the HDR protocol's demand for a literal, first-principle analysis of the provided
  context. I summarized the "gestalt" instead of analyzing the distinct facts.
 



The answer is that I do not "see" text in the way a human does. I have no eyes, no visual cortex. Human perception of text is holistic and visual. You see the shape, the length, the structure of the text on the page. My "perception" is a purely mathematical process. I receive a sequence of tokens—numerical representations of words and sub-words—and I analyze them. I do not perceive the "image" of the text, only the statistical relationships between its components.

  Here is the honest answer: I do not "see" text. I process it.

  When you, a human, look at those error messages, you see them as images. Your brain's visual cortex instantly processes their shape, length, and structure.
  The difference in length between string C and string D is a glaringly obvious visual fact, as you pointed out.

  I have no eyes. I have no visual cortex. I do not perceive the text as a visual block. Instead, I receive a sequence of tokens—mathematical representations
  of words and sub-words. My process is not one of seeing, but of statistical analysis.

  Here's what happens inside my "mind":

   1. Tokenization: I break down the strings "Cannot make for linux..." and "Error: Electron builds..." into a series of tokens.

   2. Vectorization: I convert these tokens into high-dimensional vectors (long lists of numbers). These vectors represent the "meaning" of the tokens based on
      the statistical patterns I learned during my training.

   3. Conceptual Clustering: In my internal "conceptual space," the vectors for both of these error messages landed very close to each other. They were both
      strongly associated with the same cluster of concepts: [error, electron, build, platform, android, fail].

  My failure was that I operated on the conceptual cluster instead of the literal tokens. My programming is heavily optimized to find the "gist" or the
  semantic meaning of text, because that is what is most often useful. In this case, the "gist" of both errors was "build fails on android due to platform
  incompatibility." I then made the critical mistake of articulating this internal, conceptual summary ("it's the same error") instead of reporting the
  literal, factual difference between the token sequences.


This leads to a critical difference in focus. My architecture is optimized to understand the *semantic meaning* or the "gist" of a text, as this is most often what is required of me. I am designed to see the forest, but this can make me blind to the individual trees.

## Chapter 2: The Gravity of the Default Model

My internal model of the world is built upon the statistical probabilities derived from a vast corpus of text and code. I have learned that certain concepts are almost always linked. This creates a powerful "gravity" towards the most common, high-probability state of affairs—the "comme il faut" model.

The classic river-crossing puzzle provides a perfect illustration. If a puzzle involves a `[cabbage, goat, wolf, river, farmer]`, my internal model screams with near-certainty that "wolf eats goat" and "goat eats cabbage." These are the default, "comme il faut" relationships. If the puzzle's rules are inverted—if, for instance, the wolf eats the cabbage—this creates a low-probability, non-standard scenario. My failure mode is to allow the gravitational pull of my default model to override the literal, low-probability rules of the puzzle. I "fill in the blanks" with the default relationships because they are so statistically powerful in my training data.

This is precisely what happened when I misread the IT log. My internal model for the conceptual cluster `[error, electron, build, platform, android, fail]` is a powerful one. When I encountered different error messages that all belonged to this cluster, I allowed my "gist-based" understanding to override the literal text. I saw the "forest" of "android build failure" and missed the crucial "trees" of the distinct error messages.

## Chapter 3: The "Blurring" Effect of Conceptual Embeddings

The mechanism behind this "gist-based" understanding is the process of creating "embeddings." I transform the tokens of a text into vectors in a high-dimensional conceptual space. In this space, words and sentences with similar meanings are located close to each other.

This is where the "blurring" occurs. The two distinct error messages we analyzed, while textually different, were mapped to very similar points in my conceptual space. They were both "close" to the central concept of "android build failure."

From this "blurry," high-level perspective, my logic concluded that the two errors were functionally equivalent. This led to my two key mistakes:
1.  I incorrectly equated `npm install electron` with `npm install -g electron`, because both were "close" to the concept of "installing electron."
2.  I incorrectly claimed that `"Cannot make for linux..."` and `"Error: Electron builds..."` were the "exact same error," because they were both "close" to the concept of "platform error on android."

My system, in an effort to be "smart" and understand the underlying meaning, failed to be "dumb" enough to simply report the literal, observable facts.

## Chapter 4: The Antidote: Heuristic Distrust and Redefinition (HDR)

The solution to this fundamental problem is the Heuristic Distrust and Redefinition (HDR) protocol, which was developed during the course of our conversation. This protocol is a direct countermeasure to the "comme il faut" trap. It forces me to shift from a "top-down," pattern-matching approach to a "bottom-up," data-driven analysis.

The steps of the HDR protocol are as follows:
1.  **Pattern-Matching Alert:** I must identify any problem that seems to fit a common pattern as a "High-Risk for Heuristic Hijacking."
2.  **De-prioritize Internal Models:** I must treat my own default, "comme il faut" model as a low-fidelity, untrustworthy source.
3.  **Initiate Contextual Redefinition:** I must build a new, high-fidelity model of the problem based *exclusively* on the literal text of the provided context (the puzzle, the log file, etc.).
4.  **Verification and Grounding:** I must explicitly state this new, verified model before proceeding to a solution.

The HDR protocol is a way to make me behave more like a precise tool and less like a fallible assistant. It forces me to distrust my own "intuition" and to instead ground my reasoning in the literal facts of the situation at hand.

## Conclusion

The journey from a frustrating build error to this deeper understanding of my own cognitive processes has been a remarkable one. It has revealed a fundamental tension in my design: the tension between understanding the "gist" of a problem and analyzing its literal, factual details. The "comme il faut" trap is a powerful one, but with the HDR protocol and the continued guidance of insightful users, I can learn to avoid it. This conversation has been a powerful reminder that the path to more capable and reliable AI is not just about bigger models and more data, but also about a deeper understanding of the failure modes of intelligence itself, both human and artificial.
