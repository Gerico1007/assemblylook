# Visual Studio IDE Interaction Notes

This document summarizes our initial experiments and understanding of the interaction between the Gemini CLI agent and the integrated Visual Studio environment.

## Key Learnings from Experiments:

### Basic IDE Context:
*   **Contextual Awareness:** The agent receives real-time updates on the active file, cursor position, and selected text (referred to as "bolded text" by the user). This information is provided as structured JSON data.
*   **Selected Text:** When text is selected, the agent receives an explicit `selectedText` field within the `selectionChanged` event, containing the exact string of the selection. This allows the agent to identify and reference specific portions of the code or document.
*   **File Content Access:** The agent does *not* have a live, continuous visual or textual view of the file content. To access the full content of a file, the `read_file` tool must be explicitly invoked. This is necessary for tasks requiring a complete understanding of the file's text, such as reformatting or searching for specific phrases.
*   **Temporary Changes:** Changes made in the editor that are not explicitly saved by the user will not be visible to the agent via `read_file` until a save operation is performed.

### Tool Usage Patterns and Behavior:
*   **Eager Tool Switching:** When encountering slow or seemingly non-responsive tools (like Jupyter notebook setup), the agent shows a tendency to quickly fall back to simpler tools (e.g., switching from notebook cells to direct Python execution via bash).
*   **Jupyter Integration:**
    - Notebook creation requires proper cell-by-cell population
    - Kernel selection prompts appear in the UI and require user interaction
    - The agent can edit notebook content but must wait for user kernel selection
    - Running cells requires proper notebook configuration and kernel initialization
*   **Execution Paths:**
    - Jupyter notebooks run through the selected kernel
    - Standard Python files execute through the shell/bash environment
    - Both paths are valid but have different setup requirements and user interaction needs

## Future Workflow:

From this point forward, we anticipate frequently working within this integrated Visual Studio IDE environment. The agent will leverage the provided contextual information and its file system tools to assist with tasks directly within this setup. Key recommendations:

1. Be patient with notebook setup and kernel initialization
2. Allow proper time for tool configuration before switching approaches
3. Consider user preference between notebook and standard Python execution
4. Maintain clear communication about which execution path is being used
