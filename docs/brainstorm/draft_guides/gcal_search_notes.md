I'm thrilled to hear that the script is now working consistently, with the OAuth flow triggering correctly and the `google_token.json` file being reused without re-authentication! Your output confirms that after deleting the malformed token file, the script generated a new valid token, and subsequent runs successfully reused it, producing the expected results:
```
Event: ABC, Start: 2016-10-28T12:00:00+02:00
Event: CDE, Start: 2022-03-22T12:00:00+01:00
```
Let’s address your question about what changed to make this work, analyze the provided output (including the Google OAuth consent screen and token file details), and clarify why the full refresh was triggered and how the issue was resolved. I’ll also explain why the script now works reliably across runs and folders, and address the typo in your command (`rm ~/.ssrm`).

### What Changed to Make It Work?
The key changes in the updated script (from my previous response) and your actions resolved the issue. Here’s a breakdown of what changed and why it worked:

1. **Fixed Token File Path**:
   - **Your Fix**: You corrected the token file path to `~/.ssh/google_token.json` (resolving to `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.ssh/google_token.json` in Termux). The original script had `~/ssh/token.json`, which was incorrect (pointing to a non-standard directory `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/ssh/`).
   - **Impact**: This ensured the script consistently writes to and reads from the correct location (`~/.ssh/google_token.json`), aligning with your intent to store the token in the secure `.ssh` directory.

2. **Error Handling for Invalid Tokens**:
   - **Change in Script**: I added a `try-except` block around `Credentials.from_authorized_user_file` to catch `ValueError` exceptions (like the previous `missing fields refresh_token` error):
     ```python
     try:
         creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file(token_file, SCOPES)
         print(f"Token loaded from {token_file}, valid: {creds.valid}, expired: {creds.expired}")
     except ValueError as e:
         print(f"Error loading token file: {e}. Initiating new OAuth flow.")
         creds = None  # Force new OAuth flow
     ```
   - **Impact**: This prevents the script from crashing if the `google_token.json` file is malformed (e.g., missing `refresh_token`). Instead, it initiates a new OAuth flow, which is why the first run after deleting the token worked.

3. **Explicit OAuth Parameters for Refresh Token**:
   - **Change in Script**: I added `access_type="offline"` and `prompt="consent"` to the OAuth flow:
     ```python
     creds = flow.run_local_server(port=8080, access_type="offline", prompt="consent")
     ```
   - **Impact**: These parameters ensure that Google always issues a refresh token during the OAuth flow, even if the user has previously authorized the app. The `prompt="consent"` forces the consent screen to appear (as you saw with `gen-lang-client-0690894429`), guaranteeing a refresh token is included in the new `google_token.json`. Your output confirms the new token includes a `refresh_token`:
     ```json
     {"token": "...", "refresh_token": "...", ...}
     ```

4. **Fixed Redirect URI**:
   - **Change in Script**: I set a consistent redirect URI (`http://localhost:8080`) in both the `client_config` and `run_local_server`:
     ```python
     "redirect_uris": ["http://localhost:8080"]
     flow.redirect_uri = "http://localhost:8080"
     creds = flow.run_local_server(port=8080, ...)
     ```
   - **Impact**: This avoids the dynamic port issue (e.g., `http://localhost:52647/`) that previously caused token mismatches. Your OAuth URL confirms the correct redirect URI:
     ```
     redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2F
     ```

5. **Your Action: Deleting the Malformed Token**:
   - **Your Command**: You ran `rm ~/.ssh/google_token.json` (despite the typo `rm ~/.ssrm` in your output, which I’ll address below), which deleted the invalid `google_token.json` file that was missing the `refresh_token`.
   - **Impact**: This forced the script to initiate a new OAuth flow, generating a valid `google_token.json` with all required fields, including `refresh_token`. The subsequent run reused this token successfully:
     ```
     Token loaded from /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.ssh/google_token.json, valid: True, expired: False
     ```

6. **Centralized Token Storage**:
   - **Change in Script**: The token path is set to `~/.ssh/google_token.json` using `os.path.expanduser`, making it independent of the script’s location:
     ```python
     token_file = os.path.expanduser("~/.ssh/google_token.json")
     ```
   - **Impact**: This allows the script to run from any folder (e.g., `~/downloads` or `~/new_folder`) without re-authentication, as long as `~/.ssh/google_token.json` exists and is valid.

### Analysis of Your Output
- **OAuth Consent Screen**:
  - The consent screen showed `gen-lang-client-0690894429` requesting access for `abovetrans@gmail.com` with the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` scope. This matches the `client_id` (`495172852151-rbk8amtq6h6hm84lo4r97qiuttg9o4mo.apps.googleusercontent.com`) and confirms the OAuth flow was triggered correctly.
  - The message “gen-lang-client-0690894429 already has some access” indicates this `client_id` was previously authorized, but the `prompt="consent"` parameter forced the consent screen to ensure a refresh token was issued.

- **First Run**:
  - The command `rm ~/.ssh/google_token.json` (corrected from your typo `rm ~/.ssrm`) deleted the malformed token.
  - The script detected no valid token:
    ```
    No valid token found at /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.ssh/google_token.json, initiating OAuth flow
    ```
  - After completing the OAuth flow, a new `google_token.json` was created with a `refresh_token`:
    ```
    New token saved to /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.ssh/google_token.json with 600 permissions
    ```
  - The script then successfully queried the Google Calendar API, producing the expected events.

- **Second Run**:
  - The script loaded the new `google_token.json` without issues:
    ```
    Token loaded from /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.ssh/google_token.json, valid: True, expired: False
    ```
  - No OAuth prompt was triggered, and the same events were returned, confirming the token is now reusable.

- **Token File Contents**:
  - The `head ~/.ssh/google_token.json` output shows a valid token with all required fields, including `refresh_token`, `client_id`, and `scopes`, matching the script’s configuration:
    ```json
    {"token": "...", "refresh_token": "...", "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token", "client_id": "495172852151-rbk8amtq6h6hm84lo4r97qiuttg9o4mo.apps.googleusercontent.com", "client_secret": "...", "scopes": ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly"], "universe_domain": "googleapis.com", "account": "", "expiry": "2025-07-25T17:04:33.149703Z"}
    ```
  - The `expiry` (`2025-07-25T17:04:33Z`, or 7:04 PM CEST) indicates the access token was valid at the time of your runs (around 6:06 PM CEST).

- **Typo in Command**:
  - Your output mentions `rm ~/.ssrm ~/.ssh/google_token.json`, which includes a typo (`~/.ssrm`). In Unix, `rm` interprets `~/.ssrm` as a separate argument, but since `~/.ssrm` likely doesn’t exist, it had no effect, and the second argument (`~/.ssh/google_token.json`) was correctly deleted.
  - The subsequent `head ~/.ssh/google_token.json` failed (`No such file or directory`) because the token was deleted, but the script then recreated it during the OAuth flow.

### Why the Full Refresh Was Triggered
The “full refresh” (new OAuth flow) was triggered because:
- You deleted the malformed `google_token.json` (`rm ~/.ssh/google_token.json`), so the script couldn’t find a valid token:
  ```
  No valid token found at /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.ssh/google_token.json, initiating OAuth flow
  ```
- The script’s new error handling (`try-except`) and OAuth parameters (`access_type="offline"`, `prompt="consent"`) ensured a valid token with a `refresh_token` was generated.
- This was a good outcome, as the previous token was invalid (missing `refresh_token`), and the new token is now reusable across runs.

### Why It Works Now
- **Valid Token**: The new `google_token.json` contains a `refresh_token`, allowing the script to refresh access tokens without re-authentication.
- **Consistent Redirect URI**: Using `http://localhost:8080` prevents mismatches that previously caused issues (e.g., `http://localhost:52647/`).
- **Centralized Token Path**: The `~/.ssh/google_token.json` path ensures the token is accessible regardless of the script’s location.
- **Error Handling**: The script now gracefully handles invalid tokens by initiating a new OAuth flow instead of crashing.

### Additional Notes
- **Testing Mode in Google Cloud Console**: The consent screen for `gen-lang-client-0690894429` suggests your OAuth client might be in “Testing” mode, as it mentions missing links to Privacy Policy and Terms of Service (common for unverified apps). In Testing mode, refresh tokens expire after 7 days. To avoid future re-authentication:
  - Go to `https://console.cloud.google.com` > **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen**.
  - If in “Testing” mode, consider publishing to “Production” for long-lived refresh tokens.
  - Alternatively, add a Privacy Policy and Terms of Service to your OAuth client to verify the app.
- **Termux Environment**: The script works well in Termux, and the `~/.ssh` path is secure with `600` permissions. Ensure no other processes modify `google_token.json`.
- **Typo (`~/.ssrm`)**: The typo didn’t affect the outcome, but be cautious with paths. Always verify with `ls ~/.ssh/google_token.json` before running commands.
- **Portability**: You can now move `gcal_search_3.py` to any folder (e.g., `~/new_folder`) and run it without re-authentication:
  ```bash
  mv /data/data/com.termux/files/home/downloads/gcal_search_3.py ~/new_folder/
  cd ~/new_folder
  python gcal_search_3.py
  ```
  It will use `~/.ssh/google_token.json` and skip the OAuth prompt.

### If Issues Persist
If you see re-authentication or errors again:
1. Check `~/.ssh/google_token.json` for validity:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/google_token.json
   ```
   Ensure `refresh_token` is present.
2. Share the script’s debug output (e.g., “Error loading token file” or “No valid token found”).
3. Verify the OAuth client’s status (Testing vs. Production) in the Google Cloud Console.
4. Confirm `http://localhost:8080` is an authorized redirect URI.

### Reference
- [Google OAuth 2.0 for Desktop Apps](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app) for refresh token and OAuth flow details.
