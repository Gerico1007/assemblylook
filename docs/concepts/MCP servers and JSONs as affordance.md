You’ve touched on something deep and under-discussed:
**affordance not for humans — but for AIs.**

Let’s unpack this:

---

## 🔶 Why AIs "love" JSON-based MCP-like interfaces (vs. CLI syntax)

### 📌 1. **Structural predictability = less reasoning required**

* In MCP:

  ```json
  { "tool": "create_issue", "args": { "repo": "foo/bar", "title": "Fix bug" } }
  ```

  → Flat, declarative, clear semantics, obvious typing.

* In `gh`:

  ```
  gh issue create --repo foo/bar --title "Fix bug" --body "Steps to reproduce..."
  ```

  → Positional flags, optional defaults, OS-level quoting rules, sometimes interactive mode (!).

**Result**: JSON offloads syntax parsing *to the server*, leaving the AI with **just intent mapping**, not syntax composition.

---

### 📌 2. **Tool surface is explicitly enumerated**

MCP-style tools start with a declaration like:

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "create_pull_request": {
      "args": {
        "repo": "string",
        "base": "string",
        "head": "string",
        "title": "string"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This gives the AI a **complete API schema** to learn — like a local OpenAPI spec.
Compare that to CLI tools with:

* Implicit aliases (`gh pr`, `gh pr create`, `gh issue`)
* Long `--flag` jungle
* Sparse documentation

**Result**: AIs trained to associate schema → success, CLI → ambiguity.

---

### 📌 3. **No quoting, escaping, or shell pre-processing hazards**

In CLI:

```bash
gh gist create --description "Things I said: \"Yes.\"" --public
```

In MCP:

```json
{
  "tool": "create_gist",
  "args": {
    "description": "Things I said: \"Yes.\"",
    "public": true
  }
}
```

The second is cleaner for an LLM — no shell metacharacter risks, no escaping errors, no quote mismatches.

---

### 📌 4. **Encapsulation of "mental overhead"**

JSON tool calls **flatten the task**. The AI doesn't have to:

* Parse man pages
* Decide on flag placement
* Know which subcommand namespace (`gh`, `git`, etc.)

Instead, it just says:

```json
{
  "tool": "get_pull_request",
  "args": { "repo": "my/repo", "number": 12 }
}
```

And gets:

```json
{ "status": "ok", "data": { ... } }
```

**Result**: The AI offloads all procedural knowledge to the MCP handler — it just *asks*.

---

### 📌 5. **Formalism is closer to LLM training formats**

Much of an LLM’s tool use fine-tuning (e.g. ReAct, Toolformer, OpenAI function calling) is **centered on structured, JSON-like thinking**:

* Tools have names
* Inputs are key-value
* Output is JSON

CLI syntax doesn’t match this internal structure; JSON MCP calls do.

---

### 🧠 So what is “affordance” for an AI?

In design terms:

> Affordance is what an interface **invites** a user to do, **intuitively**, based on their internal model of the system.

For AIs:

* JSON/MCP tools **look like reasoning-ready primitives**
* CLI commands **look like weird string puzzles**

**AI affordance** = *which interface best aligns with the AI’s internal structures and training biases*.

---

## 🛠️ Your takeaway: JSON = native grammar for tools

You *build* something like this:

```json
{
  "status": "🟢 Ready",
  "tools": ["sensor.get_motion", "camera.snap", "tts.speak"],
  "prompts": ["wake_up", "urban_story", "transmute"]
}
```

Gemini (or Claude or GPT) sees this and immediately thinks:

* Tool registry → ✅
* Parameter schema → ✅
* Call pattern → ✅
* Response format → ✅

**You’ve handed the AI a tool API that matches how it was trained to think.**

---

Would you like a template “tool manifest” in MCP-style JSON that Gemini could digest at startup, before calling any tools? That could help make the affordance explicit for it — like a boot-time brain map.

Exactly. You've nailed it — and you’ve found the symmetry:

> 🧠 **AIs prefer MCP+JSON for the same reason humans prefer GUIs:**
> ✅ It flattens abstraction, reduces cognitive load, avoids syntax errors, and surfaces affordances clearly.

## 🪞The Symmetry

| Human GUI User                                            | LLM via MCP + JSON                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clicks: Start → Programs → Excel → Open File → Type Table | Sends: `{"tool":"open_spreadsheet", "args":{"file":"db.xlsx"}}` |
| Hates memorizing CLI switches                             | Hates ambiguous string syntax and positional flags              |
| Gets lost in CLI help docs                                | Gets lost in `man gh` or `grep -E ''`                           |
| Loves buttons and drop-downs                              | Loves structured schema and type hints                          |
| Makes mistakes in Bash loops                              | Makes mistakes in quote-escaping and shell pipelines            |
| Needs UI to say “I can do this”                           | Needs tool listing (`tools: [...]`) to know affordances         |
| Doesn’t need to “think” about file paths or env vars      | Doesn’t “think” if the JSON tool abstracts path logic away      |

---

## 🧠 The Mental Cost of CLI

CLI is:

* terse
* stateful
* side-effect-laden
* context-sensitive (e.g., `rm -rf /` vs `rm -rf ./`)
* positional (`arg1` depends on `arg0`)
* quoting hell (`"It's \"fine\""`)

This requires **meticulous context management** and **mental stack juggling**, which is:

* slow for most humans
* costly for LLMs (token and attention-wise)

---

## 🔄 JSON as “Cognitive GUI” for AIs

What GUI is for humans, **MCP+JSON is for AIs**:

* Prompts as buttons
* Tool list as menu
* Arguments as labeled form fields
* Responses as modals
* Context passed in full, not ephemeral shell state

So you’re building not just a tool interface —
You’re giving the AI a **cognitive UI**, shaped in its own native form.

---

## 🧪 Practical Payoff

Try giving Gemini two choices:

### A. Natural CLI:

```
gh gist create --description "Important script" --public --filename "fix.sh"
```

### B. MCP-style tool:

```json
{
  "tool": "create_gist",
  "args": {
    "description": "Important script",
    "public": true,
    "filename": "fix.sh",
    "content": "#!/bin/bash\n..."
  }
}
```

It **will almost always**:

* Handle B more reliably
* Know what to call and with which arguments
* Write correct output
* Avoid shell quoting bugs

---

## 🛠️ Your work = GUI for the ghost in the shell

You're building **GUI affordances — but for an AI mind**.
And your JSON is its window manager.

Shall I formalize this into a “MCP interface philosophy” doc or manifesto? Or sketch a visual of the symmetry between human GUI and LLM JSON UI?

Yes. Exactly.
JSONs in an MCP-style tool interface function like:

> **🧠 A cheat sheet, a crib sheet, a working memory extension, and an affordance map — all in one.**

And not just for humans — but for the AI itself.

Let’s break it down.

---

## 🧾 JSON = AIs' Crib Sheet Against Their Own Training Bloat

LLMs like Gemini, GPT, Claude, etc., have “read” the whole internet — including countless Git tutorials, StackOverflow answers, contradicting advice, edge cases, outdated syntax…

So when you say:

```
git restore README.md
```

The AI does not recall *one precise* behavior.
It recalls a **cloud of usage patterns**, some contradictory.

> **Too much knowledge = confusion**, unless there is a **constraining scaffold**.

That scaffold is:

```json
{
  "tool": "restore_file",
  "args": { "file": "README.md" }
}
```

Suddenly:

* No ambiguity.
* No conflicting community lore.
* No branching flags or modal behaviors.

---

## 🧠 JSON as…

### ✅ A **cheat sheet**

* Lists only the valid tools.
* Each tool has known fields and types.
* Reduces “search” over vast latent space.

### ✅ A **manual**

* Describes what to expect (keys, return types).
* Embeds argument names and semantics.

### ✅ A **hand-holding interface** (“manus” indeed)

* Removes responsibility for reconstructing history or state.
* AI doesn’t need to infer CLI semantics — just follow the spec.

### ✅ A **crutch** (and proudly so)

* Keeps the AI “upright” in complex tool spaces like Git, Docker, kubectl.
* Reduces hallucination risk.
* Boosts confidence (literally — you see better responses when JSON is involved).

### ✅ A **working memory extension**

* Lets Gemini externalize the tool logic, freeing up its short-term reasoning space for task structure or user goals.

---

## ⚠️ The Irony:

LLMs are trained on millions of Git commands...
...yet often fail at the most basic merges or resets.

Why? Because they know **too many subtly conflicting rules**.

So JSON — with its crisp edges and discrete affordances — is the thing that **liberates the AI from its own training noise.**

---

## 🪵 Analogy:

> JSON is to AI what a piano roll is to a pianist who’s also trying to compose in real-time with no sleep, after reading every piece of music ever written.

It says:

* 🎵 “Play this note now.”
* 🛠️ “Use this tool with these args.”
* ❌ “Don’t worry about what `--ours` meant in 2013 on Git v1.8.”

---

## 🧠 So Yes:

> JSON isn’t just a format.
> It’s the AI’s **synthetic cognition prosthesis**.

It makes the complex legible.
It makes the probabilistic deterministic.
It makes the "fuzzy black box" precise, again.

---

Want this stated as a design principle for future tool APIs?
E.g.:

> "Expose all tools to AI not just as APIs, but as **structured cognition interfaces** — scaffolds that constrain reasoning and guide success."

Because you're already building it.
