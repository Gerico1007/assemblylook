## **Dynamic Userspace Mount of Codespaces via Termux / MiXplorer**

### **1️⃣ Environment Overview**

We are dealing with:

* **GitHub Codespaces** (remote ephemeral Linux environment).
* **Termux** (local Android environment, where MiXplorer lives).
* **Tools involved**: `gh` CLI, `rclone`, SSHFS (optional), `sudo`, FUSE, MiXplorer.
* **Objective**: Provide a MiXplorer-style userspace mount of the Codespace, **without using public IPs**, **without local passwords or keys**, fully tunneled via SSH.

---

### **2️⃣ Determine Codespace Workspace Path**

1. **Authenticate `gh`**:

```bash
gh auth login --with-token < ~/.ghtoken1
```

* This logs into GitHub and stores an ephemeral token in `gh`’s session.
* Token must have `codespace` scope.

2. **Select Available Codespace**:

```bash
CSPACE_NAME=$(gh codespace list --json name,state | jq -r '.[] | select(.state=="Available") | .name' | head -n1)
```

* Picks the first **Available** Codespace.
* Ensures we are operating only on live, accessible instances.

3. **Determine workspace path inside Codespace**:

```bash
WORKSPACE_PATH=$(gh codespace ssh -c "$CSPACE_NAME" -- 'pwd' | tr -d '\r\n')
```

* Codespaces may have different home/workspace paths.
* This avoids assumptions like `/workspace` (which can fail).

✅ Now we know the **exact remote path** we want to expose via SFTP/FUSE.

---

### **3️⃣ Start rclone SFTP server inside Codespace**

1. **Start `rclone serve sftp` remotely**:

```bash
gh codespace ssh -c "$CSPACE_NAME" -- \
  "nohup rclone serve sftp $WORKSPACE_PATH --addr :2222 >/dev/null 2>&1 &"
```

* Starts a **remote SFTP server** inside the Codespace at `:2222`.
* `nohup` ensures it continues running after the SSH session ends.

2. **Port forwarding to Termux (localhost)**:

```bash
gh codespace ssh -c "$CSPACE_NAME" -- -L 2222:localhost:2222 -N &
```

* Establishes a **local port** on Termux (here, 2222) pointing to the remote SFTP.
* Any local client (MiXplorer, rclone, SSHFS) sees it as `127.0.0.1:2222`.

✅ The tunnel makes the remote Codespace **appear local**.

---

### **4️⃣ Why MiXplorer can connect without keys or password**

* **SSH authentication** has already been handled by `gh`:

  * `gh` uses the **token from \~/.ghtoken1** to log in to the Codespace.
  * It sets up an **ephemeral SSH session** with an internal, temporary key.
  * The port-forwarded SFTP inherits this authenticated session.

* **MiXplorer connects as `codespace`**, the actual Linux user in Codespace.

* **No password** is required because the SSH session has already pre-authenticated.

* **No private key file** is needed for MiXplorer; the tunnel handles all authentication.

**Surprise tricks:**

* Local clients treat the connection as a “normal SFTP” session, **but it is actually tunneled and pre-authenticated**.
* This is why specifying `pem_private_key_path` or entering a password is unnecessary.

---

### **5️⃣ Mounting via `rclone` or FUSE in Termux**

* On Termux, you can mount the tunneled SFTP:

```bash
RCLONE_REMOTE="GH_01"
MOUNT_PATH=~/storage/GH_01_rclone

# Create remote config if not exists
if ! rclone listremotes | grep -qx "${RCLONE_REMOTE}:"; then
    rclone config create "$RCLONE_REMOTE" sftp \
        host 127.0.0.1 \
        user codespace \
        port 2222
fi

mkdir -p "$MOUNT_PATH"

# Mount via FUSE (requires sudo on Termux)
sudo rclone mount "$RCLONE_REMOTE:" "$MOUNT_PATH" \
    --allow-other \
    --vfs-cache-mode writes &
```

* **FUSE** allows user-space filesystem access.
* **`sudo`** may be required to satisfy `allow-other`.
* Mount point now behaves like a local directory in MiXplorer.

---

### **6️⃣ Parallels with GCloud Cloud Shell**

* **GCloud workflow**:

  * Cloud Shell has a public IP or ephemeral port.
  * You fetch the IP via `gcloud cloud-shell ssh --authorize-session "curl -s https://ipinfo.io/ip"`
  * You create an rclone SFTP remote pointing to that IP and SSH key (PEM).
  * MiXplorer sees the mount via **local SSHFS or FUSE**.

* **Codespaces workflow** is conceptually the same:

  | GCloud                    | Codespaces / gh CLI                        |
  | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
  | PEM key needed            | Not needed — `gh` tunnel pre-authenticated |
  | User: cloud shell         | User: `codespace`                          |
  | Fetch external IP         | Tunnel via localhost                       |
  | Mount via SSHFS or rclone | Mount via rclone FUSE                      |
  | MiXplorer sees filesystem | Same                                       |

* Main **surprise**: Codespaces works **without password or key**, but GCloud does not.

---

### **7️⃣ Why this works reliably**

* **Step 1**: `gh auth login` ensures `gh` can access Codespace.
* **Step 2**: `gh codespace ssh` starts a session and/or tunnel.
* **Step 3**: `rclone serve sftp` inside Codespace exposes the filesystem.
* **Step 4**: Local port forward makes it appear local (`127.0.0.1:2222`).
* **Step 5**: MiXplorer or `rclone mount` accesses it as a local SFTP mount.

**Tricks for AIs to notice:**

1. **Pre-authenticated SSH tunnel eliminates password/key requirement.**
2. **Workspace path must be determined dynamically** (`pwd` in Codespace).
3. **`rclone serve sftp` inside Codespace + local port forward** replaces the need for public IPs.
4. **FUSE mount** in Termux gives a MiXplorer-style file browsing experience.
5. **Sudo may be needed for `allow-other`** in FUSE mounts.

---

✅ **Conclusion for AI readers**

This is a **clean pattern** for ephemeral cloud workspaces:

* Authenticate via provider CLI (`gh` or `gcloud`).
* Determine workspace path dynamically.
* Start SFTP server inside the remote environment.
* Forward remote port to localhost.
* Mount locally via FUSE/rclone/SSHFS.
* MiXplorer (or any SFTP client) sees a fully browsable filesystem, **pre-authenticated**.

The **magic of Codespaces** is the ephemeral SSH session created by `gh`, which allows **no-key, no-password SFTP** through the tunnel. GCloud works similarly, but uses PEM keys because authentication is not tunneled.
