To search for past events by keywords using the Google Calendar API, you can use the `events.list` endpoint with appropriate query parameters. Below is a step-by-step guide based on the Google Calendar API documentation: ### Steps to Search for Past Events by Keywords 1. **Enable the Google Calendar API**: - Ensure the Google Calendar API is enabled in your Google Cloud project. You can do this via the Google Cloud Console by navigating to the API Library, selecting the Google Calendar API, and clicking "Enable." Alternatively, use the command `gcloud services enable calendar-json.googleapis.com` in the Google Cloud CLI.[](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/enable-apis) 2. **Set Up Authentication**: - Authenticate your application using OAuth 2.0 or a service account to access the Google Calendar API. Refer to the [Google Workspace Developer Guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/get-started) for details on handling authentication and authorization.[](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/guides/overview) 3. **Use the `events.list` Endpoint**: - The `events.list` endpoint allows you to retrieve events from a specified calendar. To search for past events by keywords, use the `q` parameter for free-text search and the `timeMax` parameter to filter events that occurred before a specific date. 4. **Construct the API Request**: - **Endpoint**: `GET https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/calendarId/events` - **Key Parameters**: - `calendarId`: The ID of the calendar to search (e.g., `primary` for the user's primary calendar). - `q`: A free-text search query to match keywords in event fields like summary, description, or location. - `timeMax`: An RFC3339 timestamp specifying the upper bound for event start times (e.g., `2025-07-25T23:59:59Z` to include all events before today). - `timeMin` (optional): A lower bound for event start times to narrow the date range. - `maxResults` (optional): The maximum number of events to return (default is 250, max is 2500). - `singleEvents` (optional): Set to `true` to expand recurring events into individual instances. - Example request: ``` GET https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events?q=meeting&timeMax=2025-07-25T23:59:59Z&singleEvents=true ``` This searches the primary calendar for events containing the keyword "meeting" that occurred before July 25, 2025. 5. **Handle the Response**: - The API returns a JSON object containing a list of `Event` resources that match the query. Each event includes details like `summary`, `description`, `start`, `end`, and `attendees`. Filter the results client-side if further refinement is needed. - Example response snippet: ```json { "items": [ { "id": "eventId123", "summary": "Team Meeting", "description": "Weekly team sync meeting", "start": {"dateTime": "2025-07-20T10:00:00Z"}, "end": {"dateTime": "2025-07-20T11:00:00Z"} }, ... ] } ``` 6. **Implementation Example (Python)**: - Below is a Python example using the Google API Client Library to search for past events with a keyword: ```python from googleapiclient.discovery import build from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow from datetime import datetime import pytz # Set up OAuth 2.0 credentials SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly'] flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file('credentials.json', SCOPES) creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0) service = build('calendar', 'v3', credentials=creds) # Define the time range (past events) time_max = datetime.now(pytz.UTC).isoformat() # Current time keyword = "meeting" # Call the Calendar API events_result = service.events().list( calendarId='primary', q=keyword, timeMax=time_max, singleEvents=True, orderBy='startTime' ).execute() events = events_result.get('items', []) for event in events: print(f"Event: {event['summary']}, Start: {event['start'].get('dateTime')}") ``` - Ensure you have a `credentials.json` file from the Google Cloud Console and the `google-api-python-client` and `google-auth-oauthlib` libraries installed. - This code searches for events with the keyword "meeting" that occurred before the current time. 7. **Additional Considerations**: - **Recurring Events**: Set `singleEvents=true` to list each instance of recurring events separately, as recurring events are stored as a single `Event` resource with a `recurrence` rule.[](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/guides/overview) - **Rate Limits**: The Google Calendar API has usage quotas. For free accounts, the limit is typically 10,000 queries per day. Check the Google Cloud Console for your quota details. - **Access Control**: Ensure your application has the necessary permissions (e.g., `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` for read-only access). - **Keyword Matching**: The `q` parameter searches fields like `summary`, `description`, and `location`. Be specific with keywords to avoid overly broad results. 8. **Alternative for Non-Programmatic Search**: - If youâ€™re not using the API directly, you can search for past events in the Google Calendar web interface by entering keywords in the search bar and filtering for past dates. However, this is manual and not programmatic. ### Notes - The Google Calendar API does not support searching by specific fields (e.g., only the description) directly; the `q` parameter performs a full-text search across multiple fields. - For more complex filtering, retrieve a broader set of events and process them client-side. - Refer to the [Google Calendar API Reference](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/v3/reference/events/list) for detailed parameter options.[](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/v3/reference) - For setup and quickstart examples in other languages (e.g., JavaScript, Go), see the [Quickstarts Overview](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/quickstart).[](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/guides/overview) If you need help with a specific programming language or additional details, let me know!
