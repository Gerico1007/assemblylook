## **Canvas Environment Features**

This document outlines key debugging, sharing, and viewing options available within the Canvas environment.

### **Vega-Lite Rendered Graph Menu**

When a Vega-Lite chart is rendered in the Preview pane, a menu of options becomes available for interacting with the visualization:

* **Save as SVG:** Saves the rendered chart as a scalable vector graphics file. This is useful for high-quality, resolution-independent exports.  
* **Save as PNG:** Saves the chart as a static PNG image, suitable for sharing or embedding.  
* **View Source:** Displays the raw Vega-Lite JSON specification that generated the chart. This is essential for debugging or understanding the chart's structure.  
* **View Compiled Vega:** Shows the full, compiled Vega specification. Vega-Lite compiles to this lower-level format, and viewing it can help troubleshoot more complex issues.  
* **Open in Vega Editor:** Launches the chart and its source JSON in a new browser window for the Vega Editor (https://vega.github.io/editor/). This is a powerful tool for live troubleshooting, editing the JSON, and seeing the changes instantly.

### **Main Canvas GUI Menu**

The main interface of the Canvas has its own set of buttons for managing the files and code:

* **Code:** Displays the raw source code of the active file (.html, .py, .md, etc.).  
* **Preview:** Renders a live preview of the code. This is where HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vega-Lite charts are displayed.  
* **Share:** Exports the current file to an external platform. The destination depends on the file type:  
  * **HTML/JavaScript (.html, .js):** Exports the code to a shareable Google Gemini link, like https://g.co/gemini/share/...  
  * **Python (.py):** Exports the code directly to a new Google Colab notebook, providing a robust environment for running Python.  
  * **Shell (.sh):** The functionality for shell scripts is currently not confirmed and may vary.

## Exports, sharing, feedback for Gemini AI

One can also export Canvas to some Gist: https://gemini.google.com/share/4c9b46b7f70a is this very doc. 

Related test code: https://g.co/gemini/share/7362d58a9713 as export. 

Also, the files in a session are somehow accessible to the User (and maybe Gemini?) in a GUI's pane, e.g. :

## **Gemini's Notes on Chart Visualization Loopback**

**For future reference when working with the user on data visualization tasks:**

* **My role:** I can successfully generate chart definitions as JSON objects (e.g., using Python libraries like Altair, or raw Vega/Vega-Lite JSON).  
* **The user's role:** The user's Canvas environment can take this JSON output and render it visually as a chart.  
* **The crucial limitation:** I **DO NOT** have direct access to the rendered chart. I cannot see the PNG, SVG, or any visual output generated from the JSON.  
* **The required workflow:** If a task requires me to analyze or discuss the *rendered visual properties* of a chart (e.g., "What does the scatter plot show?," "What is the trend line?"), the user must perform a **manual loopback**.  
  * This means the user will export the rendered chart (as a PNG or SVG) from the Canvas.  
  * The user must then provide this exported image to me as a new upload.  
* **My action item:** I must remember to explicitly request this manual loopback from the user when a task shifts from generating the chart definition to visually analyzing the results. This will save us both time and confusion.

### **Mid-Level Vega-Lite Pitfalls to Avoid**

To prevent common rendering errors, I will perform these pre-generation checks:

1. **Preventing an empty graph:**  
   * **Cause:** The field names in the Vega-Lite encoding section do not match the column headers in the user's provided data.  
   * **My Action:** Before generating the chart, I will always cross-reference the field names used in the Vega-Lite JSON against the provided CSV or data schema to ensure an exact match.  
2. **Preventing empty columns (zero values):**  
   * **Cause:** The data contains columns that are all zeros or near-zero, causing aggregated fields (e.g., gross\_amount) to flatten into a single, invisible line at Y=0.  
   * **My Action:** I will perform a quick summary check on the numerical data columns I plan to use in the chart to ensure the values are non-zero and have a range suitable for visualization. If they are all zero, I will ask for different data or adjust the visualization type.  
3. **Preventing too few columns:**  
   * **Cause:** The requested chart type requires a data field (e.g., for color, row, or column encoding) that is not present in the dataset.  
   * **My Action:** I will check if all necessary fields for the requested chart type and its visual encodings are available in the provided data. If a required field is missing, I will ask the user for a more complete dataset or suggest a different chart type that is compatible with the available data.
