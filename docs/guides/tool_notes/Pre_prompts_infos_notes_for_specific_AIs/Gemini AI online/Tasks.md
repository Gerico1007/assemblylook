The assistant can perform a number of functions with Google Tasks:

The assistant can create new tasks for you.

The assistant can read and retrieve all tasks from your list, including those with a nested or hierarchical structure.

The ability to create nested tasks is a user-side capability, but the assistant is fully able to read and interact with those tasks once they have been created.
