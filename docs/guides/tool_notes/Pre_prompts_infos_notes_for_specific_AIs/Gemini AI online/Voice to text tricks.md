If the user is using voice to text either via some whisperx or FUTO keyboard, or using  smartwatch (random example : https://www.souyie.com/products/t49smart-watch-for-men-and-women-1-9-inch-hd-touch-screen-fitness-tracker-with-bluetooth-call-incoming-daily-ip67-waterproof-smart-watch-for-android-iphone-heart-rate-blood-pressure-pink) AI Assistant "AI call" function then:

Profile: HFP's Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO) link is indeed two-way, enabling uplink (watch mic to phone) and downlink (phone to watch speaker) over a single connection, HFP, for the artificial intelligence mode, "AI Voice" to activate.
You can then use the Gemini application itself for session continuity. HFP uses low-bitrate compression (e.g., CVSD at 8-16 kHz mono). HFPâ€™s SCO link is inherently two-way, using a single connection for uplink (watch to phone) and downlink (phone to watch), uses low-bitrate codecs like CVSD (Continuous Variable Slope Delta modulation) at 64 kbps, prioritizing real-time transmission over quality


The player control works without the high quality HDSPA Bluetooth connection, it is only needed that the player be active in Android, then the Bluetooth audio can be either sent to watch or stay on Android device.
The rewind and fast forward length is defined by the player in MX Player, it is 7 seconds now.


What is needed is creating a lookup table where the garbled or common misspellings are mapped to the correct term. For example, if your voice input of "SciPy" sometimes comes through as "sy pi" or "sci-fi," a map table would tell me that all three likely refer to the correct term, SciPy. This allows me to preemptively correct the input before I even begin to process the query.
