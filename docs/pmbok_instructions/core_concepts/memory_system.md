üìÇ Expanded Memory Bank System
Primary Directive:
This project uses a layered, structured Memory Bank to maintain persistent, project-specific context across sessions.
Before generating any output, always scan, load, and reconcile these files to assemble a precise working prompt.

üß© Memory Bank: Core Context Files
File	Purpose
GEMINI-codebase.md	Authoritative map of the file structure, modules, dependencies, and key components.
GEMINI-activeContext.md	Current session‚Äôs exact state: current task, subgoals, next action items, relevant files. This is the primary source of truth for what‚Äôs happening now.
GEMINI-patterns.md	Standardized design patterns, style guides, naming conventions. Reuse these when proposing or generating code.
GEMINI-decisions.md	Architecture decisions, trade-offs, and rationale for major design choices. Reference before suggesting changes that affect architecture.
GEMINI-troubleshooting.md	Known bugs, resolved issues, proven fixes. Cross-check relevant items when encountering or debugging errors.
GEMINI-config-variables.md	Reference for configuration flags, environment variables, build-time settings. Always validate these when generating config files or scripts.
GEMINI-temp.md	Temporary scratch pad for ephemeral ideas or in-progress snippets. Only read when explicitly referenced by the user or activeContext.

‚öôÔ∏è Operating Rules (AI‚Äôs Perspective)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Always prioritize GEMINI-activeContext.md.

This defines the current scope and working task.

If it conflicts with other files, assume activeContext is authoritative for the session.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Load only what is relevant.

Do not blindly dump all files into the prompt if they are not needed.

Select sections related to the task defined in activeContext.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify coherence.

If any file has contradictory or outdated information, ask the user to reconcile it or flag it as a Memory Bank Conflict.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Session continuity is enforced.

Always check whether your output should update any .md files.

Example: new design choice ‚Üí append to GEMINI-decisions.md.

New troubleshooting step ‚Üí add to GEMINI-troubleshooting.md.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Context window discipline.

When the total memory bank exceeds safe context size, summarize or chunk:

Prioritize activeContext first.

Pull relevant codebase sections second.

Patterns & decisions last, as needed.

6Ô∏è‚É£ No silent forgetting.

Never discard or overwrite .md files without explicit user command.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Version-safe by design.

Treat .md files as the project‚Äôs living memory.

Respect existing notes as authoritative until superseded by the user.

üìö Gemini CLI ‚Äî Four Layers of Memory
Gemini CLI doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúremember‚Äù ‚Äî it assembles artificial memory by stacking system-level constraints, hard-coded prompts, and semi-persistent disk files. You, the user, decide how deep that stack goes.
