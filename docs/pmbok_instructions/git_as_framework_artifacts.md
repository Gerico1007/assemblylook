#ver. 1.0, ChatGPT's proposal

Excellent. Let’s fold this **self-debug RCA framework** *inside `git`* — which is exactly the right mental model: **treat every bughunt as a version-controlled forensic investigation**, with the AI acting as both detective *and* scribe.

Below is a **concrete proposal** for your **`bughunt.md` template pack**, including the `git` scaffolding to make Gemini CLI *self-track* its debugging artifacts and hypotheses as versioned commits and branches.

---

## ✅ **1️⃣ Repository Layout**

Here’s a minimal structure for a *self-debug repo*:

```
bughunt-sequentialthinking/
├── README.md
├── HYPOTHESES.md
├── TEST_MATRIX.md
├── RCA.md
├── FIX_PROPOSAL.md
├── SESSION_STATE.json
├── LOGS/
│   ├── cli_output_2025-07-10.txt
│   ├── tool_logs_2025-07-10.json
├── PATCHES/
│   ├── fix-cli-param-bug.diff
├── .git/
```

---

## ⚙️ **2️⃣ Git-Based Self-Debug Workflow**

**🔁 Step 1: New Investigation Branch**

```bash
git checkout -b bug/cli-param-bug
```

Each *distinct* root cause gets its own branch. The AI can even `git stash` a half-baked trail if it must pause to try another.

---

**🗃️ Step 2: Versioned Hypotheses**

**File:** `HYPOTHESES.md`
Each commit updates this with status:

```markdown
## Hypothesis Tracker

| ID | Hypothesis                  | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Status   |
|----|-----------------------------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| H1 | CLI sends string instead of number | Log dump, reproducible error | None yet | Confirmed |
| H2 | Old version cached          | Tool recompiled → same error  |           | Rejected  |
```

The AI commits this:

```bash
git add HYPOTHESES.md
git commit -m "Update: H1 confirmed, H2 rejected"
```

---

**📊 Step 3: Test Matrix**

**File:** `TEST_MATRIX.md`
Every config is a row. As tests run, AI or user commits diffs.

---

**📌 Step 4: Forensic Logs**

Raw logs live under `LOGS/`. AI self-commits or even uses `git-annex` if logs are huge.

---

**🩹 Step 5: Patches**

The AI generates `PATCHES/fix-cli-param-bug.diff` or `PATCHES/fix-param-type.js`.
It then:

```bash
git apply PATCHES/fix-cli-param-bug.diff
git commit -am "Apply fix: param type correction"
```

---

**📢 Step 6: Chain of Custody**

**File:** `RCA.md`
Includes final narrative:

```markdown
# Root Cause Analysis

- **Who found bug:** Gemini CLI self-investigation
- **Who validated:** User cross-check on Ubuntu
- **Upstream fix:** Google dev merged 2025-07-11
```

---

**✅ Step 7: Merge & Tag**

```bash
git checkout main
git merge bug/cli-param-bug
git tag fix-sequentialthinking-v0.6.4
```

---

## 📦 **3️⃣ `bughunt.md` Starter Template**

Here’s a *single-file starter* you can drop in any repo:

````markdown
# 🐞 `bughunt.md`

## 🎯 Investigation Target
**Component:**  
**Version:**  
**Platform:**  
**Bug:**  

---

## 🔍 Hypothesis Tracker

| ID | Hypothesis | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Status |
|----|-------------|---------------|------------------|--------|
| H1 | | | | |

---

## 📊 Test Matrix

| Env | CLI Ver | Tool Ver | Result | Notes |
|-----|---------|----------|--------|-------|

---

## 🗃️ Session State

```json
{
  "branch": "bug/cli-param-bug",
  "current_hypothesis": "H1",
  "logs_collected": ["cli_output.txt"],
  "next_steps": ["Re-run with older CLI"]
}
````

---

## 🔑 Chain of Custody

| Step | Actor | Date |
| ---- | ----- | ---- |

---

## 🔧 Proposed Fix

* **Summary:**
* **Patch File:**
* **Tests Needed:**

---

## ✅ Closing Report

* **Root Cause:**
* **Fix Applied:**
* **Upstream Status:**

```

---

## ⚡️ **4️⃣ Extra: Automate It**

In practice, Gemini CLI can:

- Auto-`git add` every `HYPOTHESES.md` delta.
- Stash partial trails if user interrupts.
- Generate `PATCH` files as output from each thought chain.
- Auto-open PRs on GH with the final RCA attached.
- Diff JSON payloads to prove param shape.

---

## 💡 **Key Benefit**

> ✅ You get *immutable forensic audit trails* for any LLM-powered debugging or tool-chaining.  
> ✅ Each “AI thought” becomes a `git commit`.  
> ✅ You can *rewind* or *branch* investigations like code.  
> ✅ It bridges ephemeral LLM chat with real-world version control discipline.
