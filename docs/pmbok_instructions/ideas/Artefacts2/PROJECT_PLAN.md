# Project Plan

## Objective
Create an nÃ—n grid where a spiral grows outward from the center, painting approximately half the tiles red (ðŸŸ¥) while showing all intermediate states. The spiral should begin at the exact center tile (already red), expand clockwise (Rightâ†’Downâ†’Leftâ†’Up cycles), show each distinct growth phase, and naturally preserve whitespace by terminating after filling ~50% of the grid.

## Success Criteria
- Produces the correct spiral pattern as per the example for n=5.
- Shows all distinct growth phases as defined (after each new turn or each new set of tiles).
- Naturally preserves whitespace, creating a sparse spiral.
- Uses `ðŸŸ¥` and `â¬œ` Unicode characters for grid output.

## Scope Boundaries
- The exact percentage of red tiles is not a strict requirement; approximate is sufficient, following the sparse spiral logic.
- Initial development and testing will focus on n=5, but the underlying code should be universally applicable for odd `n`.
