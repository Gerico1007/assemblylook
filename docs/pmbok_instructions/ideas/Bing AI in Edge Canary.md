## PDF reading via Bing in Edge: 

Absolutely ‚Äî here's how we form a **text-forensics tandem**, blending your CLI workflows and my AI capabilities for deep document analysis:

---

### ü§ñ What I Can Do on My Side

- **Full-context reading**: Once you upload a PDF (like *SocialMind*), I can parse its complete content ‚Äî figures, tables, captions, even references ‚Äî and quote them precisely.
- **Semantic reasoning**: Beyond quoting, I interpret meaning across the paper: which features matter, how designs relate to user needs, where assumptions are made.
- **Cross-referencing**: I detect logical links (e.g., between survey data and system architecture) and highlight them in plain language.
- **Pattern detection**: I notice recurring structures, terminology, or behavioral framing ‚Äî then suggest how they're used or possibly flawed.
- **Dynamic focus**: If you reference a line, figure, or table, I can home in and help critique or synthesize its surrounding context.
- **No hallucinations** when I have the source ‚Äî I quote, compare, and reflect without guessing.

### üíª What You Do on Your Side

- **CLI extraction**: You use `pdfinfo`, `pdf2txt.py`, `wc`, and `grep -n` to quantify PDF internals and locate string positions by line.
- **Line indexing**: With your `linepct.sh`, you convert raw line hits into precise percentage locations ‚Äî perfect for tracking where content lives inside long texts.
- **Metadata tracking**: You use `pdfinfo` to validate formats, authorship, page count, and structural expectations (like LaTeX tags or journal type).
- **Manual preview**: You can read text directly, confirm hits, or run further filters (`awk`, `sed`, etc.) to parse structure, headers, or timestamps.

### ü§ù How We Work in Tandem

1. **You upload the PDF**, I parse its full context.
2. **You spot targets**, like `"Customer-Seller"` at 52%, and tell me line position ‚Äî I respond with table context, reasoning flow, or figure links.
3. **You validate my output** using your CLI toolchain (percentages, positions, line quotes).
4. **We sync hypotheses**: If you're exploring whether the system truly adapts to social cues, we track the corresponding descriptions across sections ‚Äî using both semantic interpretation and text-forensic anchoring.
5. **If something's missing**, you point to where it *should* be. I say honestly whether it's there or not ‚Äî no sycophantic guessing.

You're the precise extractor. I‚Äôm the context-rich interpreter. Together, we create a layered understanding ‚Äî like signal + synthesis.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Usage: ./linepct.sh <search-string> <filename>
# Example: ./linepct.sh "Customer-Seller" SocialMind-IMWUT25.pdf.txt

search="$1"
file="$2"

total_lines=$(wc -l < "$file")
match_line=$(grep -n "$search" "$file" | head -n 1 | cut -d':' -f1)

if [ -z "$match_line" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå String not found."
else
  pct=$(echo "scale=2; $match_line / $total_lines * 100" | bc)
  echo "üìç '$search' appears at line $match_line of $total_lines ‚Äî approx ${pct}% through the file."
fi
```

```
~/downloads $ wc SocialMind-IMWUT25.pdf.txt            1627  19850 145213 SocialMind-IMWUT25.pdf.txt
~/downloads
```


available to Bing AI there:

```
~/downloads $ bash linepct.sh  "Customer-Seller" SocialMind-IMWUT25.pdf.txt                               üìç 'Customer-Seller' appears at line 855 of 1627 ‚Äî approx 52.00% through the file.
