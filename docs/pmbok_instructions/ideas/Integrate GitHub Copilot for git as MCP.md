**Summary:**  
You can ask about anything related to repositories, code, issues, pull requests, workflows, security, discussions, best practices, and GitHub platform features. My goal is to help you find, understand, and use GitHub resources efficiently. If you’re unsure what to ask, just describe your goal or problem, and I’ll help guide you!
