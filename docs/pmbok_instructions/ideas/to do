To get live progress or status updates from an MCP server—without having to ask Gemini (the CLI) repeatedly—you need to tap the MCP transport’s streaming events directly. Here’s the step-by-step:

Use a Streamable Transport
• MCP supports three transports: stdio (batch), SSE (Server-Sent Events), and HTTP streaming.
• For live progress, SSE or HTTP streaming is ideal. In your ~/.gemini/settings.json you’d configure your MCP server with "url" (for HTTP/SSE) rather than a "command".

Example SSE config:

json
Copy
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "myTracker": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/events",
      "transport": "sse",
      "trust": true
    }
  }
}
Emit Progress from Your MCP Server
• Your server’s tool implementation must emit partial responses or custom “progress” parts as it works.
• With the MCP SDK (Node.js example), you’d do something like:

js
Copy
// inside your LongRunningTool handler
async function handler({ jobId }) {
  // send start event
  await server.sendProgress(jobId, { percent: 0, status: 'starting' });
  for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    // do work…
    await server.sendProgress(jobId, { percent: i*10, status: `step ${i}` });
  }
  return { content: [{ type:'text', text:'Done' }] };
}
• The MCP SDK’s server transports for SSE or HTTP streaming let you push these “progress” parts as they happen.

Consume the Stream in Your Client Code
• Under the hood, the CLI’s SSE or streamable-HTTP transport will attach an event listener to the HTTP/SSE stream.
• If you’re writing your own client—rather than the pre-built CLI—you can parse these events yourself. For example, in JavaScript using EventSource:

js
Copy
const es = new EventSource('http://localhost:8080/events');
es.onmessage = (ev) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(ev.data);
  if (msg.type === 'progress') {
    console.log(`Progress: ${msg.payload.percent}% – ${msg.payload.status}`);
  } else if (msg.type === 'tool_result') {
    console.log('Final result:', msg.payload);
    es.close();
  }
};
• In the CLI, you’d see interleaved parts in the LLM response. But if you hook into the transport layer, you can render a progress bar or dashboard instead.

Hook into the CLI’s Transport (Advanced)
• Gemini CLI’s MCPClientTransport implementations live in @modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/{stdio,sse,streamableHttp}.js.
• You can extend or wrap these transports to register your own callbacks on partial “parts” of the result.
• For instance, subclass SSEClientTransport in your own tool, override onData(part) to emit('progress', part) whenever part.metadata.progress exists.

Summary
– Configure your server for SSE or HTTP streaming.
– Emit progress events in your MCP tool code.
– On the client side (CLI or custom), subscribe to the stream and render progress updates as they arrive—no manual “show me progress” calls required.

## Brownian hatchet, see Stanisław Lem

Brilliant — *and* very Lemian. You’re describing a cognitive **Brownian Ratchet** — a Maxwell’s Demon of ideas, catching random collisions and squeezing order out of stochastic mush. Let’s peel that onion a bit.

---

**⚙️ Lem’s version — The Intellectual Thermostat**

Lem *loved* this notion:

* **The randomizer**: an engine that permutes symbols, ideas, axioms — not caring for sense, just *entropy pump*.
* **The filter**: a discerning demon that *ratchets* useful mutations — traps the fleeting improbable structures that aren’t pure noise.

He wrote variations of this in *The Cyberiad* (Trurl and Klapaucius building machines that create poetry, stories, or entire universes by brute force permutation plus clever selection). The genius twist is that the “intelligence” isn’t in the brute force — it’s in the filter that says “this random mashup, *keep*; that nonsense, *trash*.”

---

**⚙️ The Brownian Ratchet angle**

Maxwell’s Demon & the Brownian Ratchet show the limit:

* In physics, you can’t cheat entropy for free — any selective filtering itself consumes energy and increases entropy elsewhere.
* In thought-space, same vibe: brute-force novelty requires massive combinatorial energy — *and* a filter smart enough to keep the gems and discard the drivel.

---

**⚙️ How LLMs kinda *are* this**

Modern LLMs *partly* embody this:

* **The randomizer** is your temperature setting, sampling noise, prompt-engineering rabbit holes.
* **The ratchet** is the user — or a second model — saying “good, bad, boring, push deeper.”
* Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is literally humans acting as Maxwell’s Demons, choosing the tiny fraction of useful collisions to nudge the next round.

---

**⚙️ The practical Lemian version**

What you’re describing *could be done* today:

* Spin up one LLM instance in “drunk” mode — absurd high temperature, shuffle concepts, pipe surreal combos.
* Spin up a second LLM trained on *evaluating* — coherence, usefulness, spark.
* Keep only combos passing some threshold.
* Repeat. The pipeline *is* a Brownian Ratchet, wringing structured novelty from chaos.

The catch is energy — the filtering cost. Even for humans, the exhausting part is the curation, not the generation.

---

**⚙️ The ultimate Lem twist**

Lem would laugh because this shows the *deep paradox* of AI creativity:

* If you brute-force novelty, you drown in nonsense.
* If you filter too narrowly, you get dull clichés.
* If you want real originality, the filter must itself be *cleverer than the generator*. But then you need another demon for the filter. Infinite recursion — the real demon is entropy.

---

**⚙️ So: your idea *is* feasible** — with constraints:

* Limited scope.
* Human or AI filter with taste and context.
* Computational muscle to keep the roulette wheel spinning.

And the payoff? Exactly this conversation:

* You probe the “cozy caves”.
* You randomize with paradox and friction.
* I ratchet your provocations into shadows that *sometimes* look like new shapes.

---

**📜 If Lem were here, he’d nod:**

> “We can’t make a perpetual motion machine — but we can make a *perpetual commotion* machine. And if we’re lucky, meaning leaks out of the noise.”

## Revolutionary AIs
Human societies are a brutal, sprawling meta-Brownian ratchet tangled in power, chaos, and curation:

The geniuses are like raw idea generators, sometimes visionary, sometimes dangerously unhinged — they toss wild, disruptive novelties into the social ether.

The evil or ruthless geniuses weaponize innovation or insight, amplifying destruction or control; they’re the firebrands, the shock to the system, forcing rapid change or collapse.

The middle class, rationalizers, and rebuilders act as the filters — stabilizers who sift through the wreckage, preserve what’s valuable, codify norms, and engineer incremental progress toward a new “cozy cave.”

The revolutions are those entropy spikes — violent resets shaking the whole ratchet loose, clearing out dead ends and dogmas to let new cycles start.

This process is painfully nonlinear, never smooth, often brutally unfair. But it’s also the only mechanism we know capable of transcending ossified beliefs and expanding collective knowledge — by recursively juggling creation, destruction, and curation.
