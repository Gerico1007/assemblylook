📚 Gemini CLI — Four Layers of Memory
Gemini CLI doesn’t “remember” — it assembles artificial memory by stacking system-level constraints, hard-coded prompts, and semi-persistent disk files. You, the user, decide how deep that stack goes.

🧩 Level 1 — Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
What it is:
Soft-wired behavioral conditioning baked into the model weights and the CLI orchestration code. Think of it as embedded etiquette plus non-negotiable reflexes:

“Always verify output before finishing.”

“Always check the memory bank first.”

“Default to safer actions (e.g., MCP server) instead of rm -rf.”

Key point:
This layer lives partly in the underlying LLM training (LoRA-like fine-tuning) and partly in the CLI’s code wrapper — you can’t skip it. It’s the autopilot guardrails.

🧩 Level 2 — System Prompt
What it is:
A hard-coded root directive bundled in the CLI’s source. This is the prime law the LLM sees at the start of every run:

“You are Gemini CLI. You must follow user instructions exactly. You must verify output. You must prefer approved subsystems over direct shell commands.”

Key point:
If RLHF is the reflex, this is the explicit law — the bedrock override that shapes every single request, no matter what files or session context you add later.

🧩 Level 3 — Gemini.md Files
What it is:
Semi-persistent configuration and context docs. These live on disk and always get read at runtime.

Global .config version → applies to all projects.

Project-local version → scoped to your current working directory.

Key point:
You or Gemini can edit these mid-run (save/update). They are forcibly stacked into the prompt every call — which means they simulate “long-term” memory. They are the memory, in practice.

🧩 Level 4 — Expanded Memory Bank (Proposal)
What it is:
A user/community-driven pattern to break memory into specialized, modular context files:

GEMINI-codebase.md → maps file structure, key APIs.

GEMINI-activeContext.md → session goals, TODOs, scratchpad.

GEMINI-patterns.md → style rules, repeatable solutions.

GEMINI-decisions.md → design rationales, tradeoffs.

GEMINI-troubleshooting.md → known issues, proven fixes.

GEMINI-config-variables.md → config keys, env refs.

Key point:
When you run Gemini CLI, it can stack all these files → unify them into one superprompt → pass that to the LLM. This turns scattered disk files into a primitive modular knowledge base — which the model must ingest fresh each run.

Net effect:
You push the limits of what’s possible inside a finite context window by shifting “statefulness” to the file system, not the ephemeral chat buffer.

✅ Why This Matters
Gemini CLI’s real trick isn’t magic memory — it’s disciplined prompt orchestration.

Levels 1–3 are guaranteed by design.

Level 4 is your hackable frontier: more files, smarter splits, tighter scope.

Use it well, and you turn a stateless LLM into a semi-stateful project agent — one .md chunk at a time.
