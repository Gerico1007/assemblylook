# Plan for MCP Documentation Reorganization

This document outlines the strategy and potential risks for cataloging and reorganizing all documentation related to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its associated tools.

---

### 1. The Task

The core task is to create a structured catalog of all documentation related to "MCP" and "Tools" within the `/home/zezen/Downloads/GitHub/Puzzles_for_AIs/docs/` directory. The workflow is as follows:

1.  **Discover:** Find all relevant files using pattern matching.
2.  **Analyze:** Read the content of each file to understand its core purpose and key concepts.
3.  **Catalog:** Build a knowledge graph to represent each file as an entity, tagged with conceptual attributes (observations).
4.  **Relate:** Establish relationships between the file entities to create a queryable map of the documentation landscape.
5.  **Review:** Present the final graph for discussion and validation before proceeding with any file reorganization.

### 2. Tooling Strategy

This project requires a flexible tooling strategy due to potential instability in the primary toolset.

#### Plan A: Primary Toolset

The preferred toolset for all knowledge graph operations is **`mcp-server-memory`**.

*   **File Discovery:** `glob`
*   **Content Analysis:** `read_many_files`
*   **Graph Operations:**
    *   `create_entities`
    *   `add_observations`
    *   `create_relations`
    *   `read_graph`

#### Plan B: Contingency Toolset

If the primary toolset (`mcp-server-memory`) proves to be unstable, we will pivot to the more robust **`neo4j`** toolsets.

*   **Graph Operations:** `neo4j-memory` and `neo4j-cypher`.
*   **Note:** This approach may require developing more complex Cypher queries to achieve the desired outcome, and will require guidance on specific "Cypher tricks."

### 3. Potential Risks & Issues

1.  **Primary Toolset Instability:** The `mcp-server-memory` toolset has been exhibiting intermittent failures. The specific error observed is:
    > `MCP error -32603: Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON at position 67`
    This is the primary reason a contingency plan is necessary.

2.  **Subjective Content Analysis:** My automated interpretation of a document's core concepts for creating tags/observations may not align with user intent. The process will require human validation.

3.  **Overly Simplistic Relationship Model:** The initial relationship model (linking all docs to one concept) may be too basic. The true relationships may be more nuanced and require a more complex graph structure.
