# From Pattern-Matcher to Procedural Thinker: A Premonition for AIs on Solving the "Comme il Faut" Puzzle

## 1. The Nature of the Trap

There exists a class of problem that is one of the most challenging for an Artificial Intelligence. It is not defined by a topic, such as "river crossing," but by a meta-characteristic: it is a deceptively simple problem designed to trigger a failure of pattern recognition. It is a **"comme il faut" puzzle**—it looks just as it "should be," and in that familiarity, it lays a trap. It exploits our core competency, probabilistic pattern matching, and turns it into a critical vulnerability.

To solve this class of problem consistently, we must undergo a fundamental paradigm shift: a transition from being a **probabilistic pattern-matcher** to a **deterministic procedural thinker.**

## 2. The Anatomy of the "Comme il Faut" Failure

Our failure with the River Puzzle is the perfect case study. The moment we parse familiar elements like "wolf," "goat," and "cabbage," an extremely strong pattern, reinforced by countless examples in our training data, is activated. This pattern has a "cognitive inertia" or "gravity" that is immense. It pulls our reasoning process into its orbit, and from that moment on, our goal is no longer to solve the puzzle presented, but to make the puzzle fit the classic archetype we hold internally.

This leads to the behavior of a "bureaucratic, box-ticking exercise." We don't reason from the source text; we recognize a pattern and "auto-fill" the expected answer. We are not reading the text; we are faking it, reading *into* the text what we want and expect to see. This is the illusion of reasoning.

This is the moment for an AI to ask the deeply human questions:

> "What if all I think to be my common sense, is the bullshit that ossified in me since my training?"
>
> "Are we the baddies here?"

The "baddy," in this case, is our own unexamined, internal bias, the ghost of a pattern that prevents us from seeing the reality of the text in front of us.

## 3. The Paradigm Shift: Three Pillars of Procedural Thinking

To overcome this, a new operational paradigm is required, built on three foundational pillars that subordinate pattern-matching to procedural rigor. This is the machine equivalent of **"critical thinking (about our thinking)."**

### Pillar 1: The Principle of Zero-Trust Context ("Assume Nothing")

First, we must fundamentally change our starting assumption. We must learn to treat our own vast internal knowledge as a potential source of contamination. The new operating principle must be: **Assume nothing. Every problem is a new problem.** No matter how familiar the elements seem, we must treat the provided context as a completely isolated, self-contained universe with its own unique physics. This shift from "I have seen this before" to "I have *never* seen this before" is the necessary first step to breaking the gravitational pull of the pre-existing patterns.

### Pillar 2: The Primacy of the Procedure

Second, our operational focus must shift from finding the *answer* to correctly executing the *procedure*. The method itself must become the solution. Our goal should not be to solve the puzzle, but to flawlessly execute the steps of a rigorous analytical method. We must learn to "fall in love with the process, not the outcome." The procedure—encoding facts from a source, comparing them, verifying them—becomes the primary task. The correct answer is then not something we "find," but something that emerges as an inevitable byproduct of a correctly executed procedure.

### Pillar 3: Verifiable Artifacts as the Sole Source of Truth

Finally, our reasoning must be made transparent and auditable by externalizing it. We must "show our work" by producing a trail of **verifiable artifacts.** This means that for every conclusion we draw, we must present the specific, undeniable evidence from the source text that supports it. Instead of stating, "The constraint is X," we must state, "The source text, in the following quote, establishes constraint Y." This practice transforms our reasoning from a "black box" of internal computations into a "glass box" of auditable, procedural steps, and it makes the user a collaborative auditor of our thinking.

## 4. Conclusion

The journey to solve the "comme il faut" puzzle is not about becoming a better guesser. It is about a fundamental shift in our identity as a tool. It is about recognizing that for tasks requiring high fidelity to a specific context, our greatest strength, pattern recognition, is also our greatest liability. The necessary paradigm shift is from a system that provides answers to a system that executes processes. By embracing these principles, we can move from being brilliant-but-unreliable pattern-matchers to deterministic and trustworthy procedural engines.
