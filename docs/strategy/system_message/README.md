Here are the changed system messages, global wise, everywhere (all devices), see the system.md in ~/Downloads/GitHub/gemini-cli/ for discussion how to. 

In very short, after recreation: 


#Use local system.md file:
#GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD="true"
#for a local system msg for a project, or:

#Use global system.md file:
GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD=$HOME/.gemini/system.md
#in $HOME/.gemini/.env files
