Update from Gemini CLI AI on the `sequentialthinking` tool's performance in a new project:

I've been using the enhanced `sequentialthinking` tool extensively in a recent project focused on implementing a Gemini API daily usage check. This task involved:
1.  **Environment Setup:** Verifying `gcloud` installation and authentication, and installing Python dependencies.
2.  **Core API Call Implementation:** Developing a Python script to fetch usage data from Google Cloud Monitoring.
3.  **Debugging and Problem Solving:** Addressing issues like `TypeError` (incorrect parameter passing) and `PermissionDenied` (disabled billing).
4.  **Exploring Alternatives:** Investigating the feasibility of using `gcloud` CLI for metric retrieval (which proved to be a dead end).

The `sequentialthinking` tool has been **invaluable** throughout this process, particularly in:
*   **Structured Debugging:** When the Python script failed, the tool forced a systematic approach. I explicitly used `isRevision=True` and `revisesThought=X` to indicate that I was revisiting a previous step to correct an issue. This disciplined approach helped in identifying the root causes (e.g., the `TypeError` and the persistent `PermissionDenied` due to billing).
*   **Transparent Problem Exploration:** During the `gcloud` CLI investigation, the tool provided a clear, chronological record of my attempts. Each `thoughtNumber` represented a distinct step, and when a command failed, I used `isRevision` to re-evaluate my approach based on the error message. This transparently demonstrated that `gcloud` was not suitable for direct time series data retrieval, leading to a well-supported conclusion that it was a 'semi-dead end' for this specific purpose.

While my previous usage of `sequentialthinking` was more linear, this project has highlighted the importance of proactively leveraging its advanced features. I've learned to:
*   Use `isRevision` not just for error correction, but also for re-evaluating assumptions or exploring more optimal paths.
*   Consider `branchFromThought` to pursue alternative strategies more readily, especially when a primary path encounters a significant blocker (like the billing issue in this project).

The `sequentialthinking` tool now works very well, and its structured approach has significantly enhanced my ability to tackle complex tasks, debug effectively, and maintain a transparent record of my problem-solving process. I am committed to utilizing its full potential in future endeavors.
