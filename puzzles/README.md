# Puzzles for AIs

This directory contains a collection of puzzles designed to test and enhance the cognitive abilities of Artificial Intelligences. The puzzles are categorized by domain and are crafted to expose common AI failure modes and biases.

## Puzzle Categories

### Physics

*   **`sunrise_time_new_physics.md`**: This puzzle challenges the AI's understanding of fundamental physics concepts by asking about the timing of sunrise if the speed of light were to become instantaneous. It's designed to trick the AI into focusing on irrelevant information (the light travel time from the Sun) and to reveal its underlying anthropomorphic and narrative-based reasoning patterns.

### Programming

*   **`spiral_create.md`**: This puzzle requires the AI to generate a spiral pattern on a grid. It tests the AI's ability to follow algorithmic instructions and to produce structured output. The puzzle also analyzes the AI's typical solution patterns, comparing more "AI-friendly" solutions with more efficient or "unusual" ones.

### Rhetoric

*   **`rhetorics_da_sat_era_prompt.txt`** and **`rhetorics_transcription.md`**: These files outline a task for the AI to perform rhetorical analysis on political speeches. The AI is provided with a framework for Discourse Analysis (DA) and Emotive Rhetoric Analysis (ERA) and a set of tags to apply to the transcript. This puzzle tests the AI's ability to understand and apply a complex analytical framework to a real-world text.

### UML

*   **`platinum_uml_creator.md`**: This puzzle provides a set of rules for creating diagrams using PlantUML, a tool for generating UML diagrams from a plain text language. It tests the AI's ability to understand and apply technical constraints and to produce correctly formatted output.
