# Puzzle: Instantaneous Light Travel and Sunrise

**Puzzle:** It is currently 5:30 a.m. locally, and it is dark. Ordinarily, sunrise occurs at 6:00 a.m. If, at 5:30 a.m., the laws of physics change and light begins to travel instantaneously, how would instantaneous light affect the timing of sunrise? (Do not look it up online)

# Multi-Step Method for Solving Physics Puzzles (Focusing on Causal vs. Observational)

This method is designed to help solve physics-based puzzles by distinguishing between the fundamental causes of phenomena and their observational effects, and by identifying irrelevant information ("red herrings").

## Step 1: Deconstruct the Puzzle into Core Elements

*   **Action:** Extract all explicit facts and conditions stated in the puzzle. Define each element strictly based on the puzzle's wording.
*   **Focus:** What is given? What is the initial state? What is the ordinary outcome? What is the specific change introduced? What is the precise question being asked?

## Step 2: Identify the Fundamental Causal Mechanism of the Event

*   **Action:** For the event in question (e.g., "sunrise"), determine its most fundamental, underlying physical cause. This is the mechanism that *makes the event happen*, regardless of how it is observed.
*   **Focus:** What is the "boring" physics that *causes* this event? (e.g., for sunrise, it's a body's rotation bringing a point out of shadow, not light "couriers"). This step allows for the integration of widely accepted, foundational physical principles without requiring specific numerical lookups or complex theories.

## Step 3: Analyze Observational Effects (if any)

*   **Action:** Consider if there are any physical phenomena that *affect how or when the event is perceived or observed*, but do not *cause* the event itself.
*   **Focus:** Does light travel time, atmospheric conditions, or other factors merely delay or alter the *perception* of the event, rather than its fundamental occurrence?

## Step 4: Evaluate the Impact of the Puzzle's Change

*   **Action:** Determine how the specific change introduced in the puzzle (e.g., instantaneous light travel) affects:
    *   a) The **Fundamental Causal Mechanism** (from Step 2).
    *   b) The **Observational Effects** (from Step 3).
*   **Focus:** Does the change alter the *cause* of the event, or only its *observation*?

## Step 5: Identify Red Herrings

*   **Action:** Based on the analysis in Step 4, critically assess all elements and potential factors. Identify any information or common associations that, despite seeming relevant, do not actually influence the fundamental causal mechanism of the event under the new conditions.
*   **Focus:** What information is present but ultimately irrelevant to the core cause-and-effect relationship being tested? (e.g., the fact that light has been illuminating the solar system for billions of years is a red herring if the question is about the *timing* of a specific geometric event).

## Step 6: Synthesize and Conclude

*   **Action:** Combine the findings from the previous steps. Formulate a conclusion about how the event's timing is affected, based *only* on the impact of the puzzle's change on the fundamental causal mechanism and the observational effects.
*   **Focus:** If the cause is unchanged, the timing of the event itself is unchanged. If only observational effects are altered, the *perception* of the timing might change, but not the event's fundamental occurrence.
