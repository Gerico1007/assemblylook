# Sunrise Puzzle Solution

## The Correct Answer

The change in the speed of light would have **no effect** on the timing of sunrise. It would still occur at 6:00 a.m.

### Explanation

1.  **Sunrise is a Geometric Event:** Sunrise is defined by the moment the upper limb of the Sun becomes visible on the horizon. This event is fundamentally caused by the **rotation of the Earth**. For an observer at a specific location, the Earth must rotate a certain amount to bring the Sun into their line of sight.

2.  **Earth's Rotation is Unchanged:** The puzzle states that only the speed of light changes. It does not mention any change to the Earth's rotational speed or its axial tilt. Therefore, the 30-minute interval between 5:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. represents the time required for the Earth to rotate the necessary angle to make the Sun visible.

3.  **Speed of Light is an Observational Factor, Not a Causal One:** Under normal physics, the light from the sun takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach us. This is an observational delay. Making the speed of light instantaneous eliminates this delay, meaning we would see the Sun's *true* position in real-time. However, at 5:30 a.m., the Sun is still geometrically below the horizon for that observer.

The core of the problem is separating the cause (Earth's rotation) from an observational effect (light travel time). Since the cause remains constant, the timing of the event does not change.
