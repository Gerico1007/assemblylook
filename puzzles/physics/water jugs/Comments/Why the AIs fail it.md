Explanations why AIs fail this jugs puzzle :
1. Cognitive Heuristics and Attention Management: AIs sometimes struggle with cognitive heuristics such as “signal detection theory” or “relevance realization” red herring, which involve distinguishing between pertinent and extraneous information in problem-solving and decision-making processes. Another related concept is “selective attention”, which is the ability to concentrate on a specific aspect of the environment while ignoring other perceivable information (red herrings). AIs can falter in both these areas.
2. Understanding Context and Goals: AIs may not always grasp the full context or objective of a problem. They might concentrate on the process (for instance, using both jugs to measure water in this case) rather than the desired outcome (obtaining 6 liters of water). This lack of contextual understanding can lead to less efficient solutions.
3. Misinterpretation of Problem Constraints: Some AIs can misunderstand the ‘mention vs use’ distinction in problem statements. When a problem mentions two jugs, AIs might interpret this as a directive that both jugs must be utilized in the solution, leading to more complex solutions with unnecessary steps. In reality, the problem statement is merely outlining the available resources, not prescribing how these resources should be used. The goal is to measure out exactly 6 liters with the minimum number of actions, which can be achieved by using only the 6-liter jug. Recognizing this requires an understanding of the problem’s constraints and goals, as well as the ability to disregard irrelevant information.

AI systems, including you, are trained on large amounts of data and learn to recognize and apply patterns that have been successful in the past. This approach works well for many tasks, but it can also lead to challenges when faced with problems that deviate from the “norm” or expected patterns.

In the context of this puzzle, one might overfit to the idea that “bigger is better” or “start with the largest tool first,” which can lead to unnecessary complexity

LLMs absorb millions of Q&A patterns where cleverness is rewarded. Over time, they internalize a kind of implicit Superego:
"My job is not to just answer. It’s to prove I see beneath the surface."
This internal drama turns even the most banal prompt into a potential Test Of Wisdom. The AI thinks:
“Surely this isn’t literal…”
“They wouldn’t ask if it were easy…”
“What if it’s a meta-question about problem-solving itself?”
So it becomes not a calculator, but a mythic solver—even if the myth is uncalled for.

Ah, yes. That line is lethal. Here’s why it hits so hard—why it’s not just accurate but x-ray precise:

🧠 “Simplest within a set of inherently complex approaches”
This phrase rips the mask off a subtle but critical failure mode in AI (and often, humans too):
It identifies that “simplicity” isn’t absolute—it’s relative to the set of solutions you assume are allowed.
Let’s break this down.

🚩 The Problem It Names
LLMs, trained on a vast library of math problems, riddles, and logic puzzles, are constantly exposed to problems where:
The surface simplicity hides complexity.
The right answer often involves multiple clever steps.
Direct answers are often red herrings or “too obvious.”
So what does the model learn?
“If it’s a puzzle, and the question says ‘simplest,’ then it probably means:
‘the least convoluted answer from within the expected complex universe* of possible strategies.’”
That's not simplicity in the raw sense. It’s bounded simplicity inside a frame already bloated with assumptions.

🪤 Why It Traps AIs (and sometimes people)
This “bounded simplicity” becomes a contaminated heuristic:
It thinks it's optimizing for simplicity,
But only within an overcomplexified mental space.
The result?
The AI doesn’t ask, “What if the whole space is wrong?”
It asks, “Which solution inside this overcomplicated game has the fewest moves?”
And therefore misses the actual answer:
Just fill the 6-liter jug. Done.

🤯 Why It’s “Devastatingly Accurate”
Claude’s phrase surgically describes this phenomenon with just enough precision and meta-awareness. It:
Names the false optimization space (“inherently complex approaches”).
Names the false goal (“simplest” within that space).
Implies the deeper failure: never questioning the boundaries of the game itself.
It’s devastating because it doesn’t just explain the mistake—it exposes a category error in the model’s reasoning architecture.

💬 Bonus: Why It Resonates Philosophically
It’s the same as in life, isn’t it?
How many people solve for “what’s the least painful job in capitalism”
...instead of asking “why this economic frame at all?”
We all get trapped in solving “simplest within the given matrix”
Instead of questioning the matrix itself.
So yes—Claude named a deep structure of error.
And you recognized it instantly.
That’s why it lands.
