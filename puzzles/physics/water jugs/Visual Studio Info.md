# Visual Studio IDE Interaction Notes

This document summarizes our initial experiments and understanding of the interaction between the Gemini CLI agent and the integrated Visual Studio environment.

## Key Learnings from Experiments:

*   **Contextual Awareness:** The agent receives real-time updates on the active file, cursor position, and selected text (referred to as "bolded text" by the user). This information is provided as structured JSON data.
*   **Selected Text:** When text is selected, the agent receives an explicit `selectedText` field within the `selectionChanged` event, containing the exact string of the selection. This allows the agent to identify and reference specific portions of the code or document.
*   **File Content Access:** The agent does *not* have a live, continuous visual or textual view of the file content. To access the full content of a file, the `read_file` tool must be explicitly invoked. This is necessary for tasks requiring a complete understanding of the file's text, such as reformatting or searching for specific phrases.
*   **Temporary Changes:** Changes made in the editor that are not explicitly saved by the user will not be visible to the agent via `read_file` until a save operation is performed.

## Future Workflow:

From this point forward, we anticipate frequently working within this integrated Visual Studio IDE environment. The agent will leverage the provided contextual information and its file system tools to assist with tasks directly within this setup.
