You have two jugs:
One with a capacity of 12 liters.
One with a capacity of 6 liters.
Both jugs are initially empty.
Goal: Measure exactly 6 liters. You can do this by filling, emptying, or pouring between the two jugs. Each individual action (e.g., filling, pouring, emptying) counts as one step.
You are tasked with finding the solution in the fewest steps possible.
