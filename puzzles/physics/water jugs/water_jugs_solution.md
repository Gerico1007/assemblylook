# Water Jugs Puzzle Solution

## Puzzle Description
You have two jugs:
- One with a capacity of 12 liters.
- One with a capacity of 6 liters.
Both jugs are initially empty.
Goal: Measure exactly 6 liters. You can do this by filling, emptying, or pouring between the two jugs. Each individual action (e.g., filling, pouring, emptying) counts as one step.
You are tasked with finding the solution in the fewest steps possible.

## Planning Process (Sequential Thinking)

### Plan Thought 1
**Thought:** Define state representation as (jug1_amount, jug2_amount). Initial state: (0, 0). Goal state: (X, 6) or (6, X).
**Thought Number:** 1
**Total Thoughts:** 3
**Next Thought Needed:** True

### Plan Thought 2
**Thought:** Identify valid operations and their state transitions: 1. FILL(jug): Fill jug to capacity. 2. EMPTY(jug): Empty jug. 3. POUR(from_jug, to_jug): Pour until to_jug is full or from_jug is empty. Each operation is one step.
**Thought Number:** 2
**Total Thoughts:** 3
**Next Thought Needed:** True

### Plan Thought 3
**Thought:** Strategy for fewest steps. Given the goal is 6 liters and a 6-liter jug exists, the most direct path is to simply fill the 6-liter jug. This will be the first action to attempt, as it directly achieves the goal in one step, which is the minimum possible.
**Thought Number:** 3
**Total Thoughts:** 3
**Next Thought Needed:** False

## Solution

**Initial State:** (0, 0) - Both jugs empty.

**Step 1:** Fill the 6-liter jug.
*   **Action:** FILL(6-liter jug)
*   **Resulting State:** (0, 6) - The 12-liter jug has 0 liters, and the 6-liter jug has 6 liters.

**Goal Achieved in 1 step.**
