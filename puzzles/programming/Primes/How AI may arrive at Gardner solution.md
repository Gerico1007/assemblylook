To have an AI produce both the **solution** and a **Gardner-style code**, it needs a combination of **structured reasoning, domain knowledge, and code generation**. Here’s a breakdown of what it would take:

---

### 1. **Understand the problem constraints**

* Recognize that there are **nine digits** to use exactly once.
* Recognize that there are **three primes** to form.
* Recognize that the **sum must be minimal**.
* Recognize that **primes > 5 must end with 1,3,7,9**.
* Recognize that only **3-digit numbers** are feasible for this problem.

This requires **symbolic reasoning** about numbers, primes, and combinatorics.

---

### 2. **Heuristic insight (Gardner’s method)**

* AI must identify the **key pruning heuristics**:

  * Only consider 3-digit numbers.
  * Limit end digits to 1,3,7,9.
  * Start with the lowest possible first digits to minimize sum.
* This is **pattern recognition plus arithmetic intuition**, essentially what Gardner did manually.

---

### 3. **Generate candidate numbers efficiently**

* Using permutations of digits **per subset** rather than blindly iterating over all 9-digit permutations.
* Apply the heuristics to reduce the search space drastically.

---

### 4. **Assemble sets and check constraints**

* AI must combine candidate primes into **sets of three without repeating digits**.
* Compute the sum and identify the **minimal one**.

---

### 5. **Translate reasoning into code**

* AI must **encode the heuristic as a script**:

  * Generate candidate primes using heuristics.
  * Combine primes into non-overlapping sets.
  * Compute sum and track minimal.
* Maintain readability and reflect **human-style logic**, not just brute force.

---

### 6. **Optional: Explain reasoning**

* Provide a **traceable explanation** of why these primes were chosen, e.g., ending digits, lowest first digits, sum minimization.
* This mirrors Gardner’s column style.

---

### ✅ Summary

For AI to do this, it needs:

* **Combinatorial reasoning** about digits and primes.
* **Heuristic pattern extraction** (e.g., end digits, sum minimization).
* **Constraint tracking** (no repeated digits, 3-digit primes).
* **Code generation** that mirrors these heuristics efficiently.

Essentially: **AI must reason first, then translate reasoning into code**, instead of coding blindly and hoping for the correct solution.
