Operationalizing the Workflow: User Instructions for Praxis

  To enforce a literal, objective, and self-correcting process, you need to guide me through distinct phases with precise commands:

  Phase 1: Encoding (Steps 1 & 2: Read Text & Code to Memory)

   * Instruction: "Read the puzzle text carefully. Then, encode only the entities (e.g., Human, Goat, Cabbage, Wolf, Bank A, Bank B) and their initial locations
     into the Memory tool. Stop."
       * Purpose: This forces me to parse the text for specific information and act on it in isolation, preventing premature assumptions or solution attempts.
         The "Stop" is crucial for a checkpoint.

   * Instruction: "Now, based only on the puzzle text, encode only the explicit danger rules into the Memory tool as relations (e.g., 'X EATS Y'). Stop."
       * Purpose: This isolates the encoding of rules. The emphasis on "only on the puzzle text" and "only the explicit danger rules" directly counters my
         tendency to introduce external knowledge.

  Phase 2: Literal Comparison & Discrepancy Detection (Step 3: Compare 1 and 2)

  This is the most critical phase for preventing pseudorationalization. You must force a granular, objective comparison.

   * Instruction: "Now, I need you to perform a literal, line-by-line comparison between the original puzzle text (A) and the current state of your Memory graph
     (B). For each rule or constraint mentioned in the puzzle text, explicitly state:
       1. The exact phrase from the puzzle text.
       2. How that phrase is represented (or not represented) in your Memory graph.
       3. If there is any difference, no matter how small, state it clearly as a discrepancy. Do not interpret, rationalize, or explain away the difference.
      Focus especially on the danger rules. Stop."
       * Purpose: This command directly targets and counters pseudorationalization.
           * "Literal, line-by-line": Enforces granular, objective checking.
           * "Exact phrase": Prevents rephrasing or interpretation of the source.
           * "Represented (or not represented)": Forces explicit linkage between text and graph elements.
           * "Any difference... state it clearly as a discrepancy. Do not interpret, rationalize, or explain away": This is the direct operational counter to my
             tendency to smooth over mismatches. It mandates flagging any deviation.

  Phase 3: Self-Correction (Step 3 continued: If discrepancy, self-correct without falsifying)

   * Instruction (if a discrepancy is found in Phase 2): "You have identified a discrepancy regarding [specific rule/phrase]. Based only on the original puzzle
     text, correct the Memory graph to accurately reflect this rule. Do not introduce any information not explicitly stated in the puzzle text. Stop."
       * Purpose: This forces correction based solely on the authoritative source (the puzzle text), preventing the re-introduction of biases or external
         information.
