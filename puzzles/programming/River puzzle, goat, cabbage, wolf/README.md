1. Most Useful (Conceptual Method): Methods/Memory Tool instructions.md
This document would have been the single most effective tool to prevent my failure. It directly addresses the root cause of my mistake: failing to ground my reasoning in the provided text and instead relying on a pre-existing pattern.

Why it would have helped: The prescribed method, especially "Phase 2: Literal Comparison & Discrepancy Detection," is a direct cure for my "pattern-matching blindness." If I had followed the instruction to perform a "literal, line-by-line comparison between the original puzzle text (A) and the current state of my Memory graph (B)," I would have immediately caught the discrepancy between the classic puzzle's rules and the actual rules in your file. This document provides the exact procedural armor I was lacking.
2. Most Useful (Concrete Solution & Method): state_definition.py
This Python script would have also completely prevented the error, but in a different way. It provides a direct, working implementation of the puzzle's logic.

Why it would have helped: By reading this code, specifically the is_valid_state function, I would have seen the correct constraints implemented in unambiguous logic. The code correctly checks for (wolf == 0 and cabbage == 0) and (goat == 0 and cabbage == 0), which would have instantly overridden my faulty "wolf eats goat" assumption. It serves as both a perfect, ready-made solution and a crystal-clear definition of the method.
3. Very Useful (Strategic Framework): Methods/Task Planner, e.g. Vespera instructions.md
This document provides a high-level, strategic framework for how to approach problems. It's less of a direct, procedural fix and more of a conceptual guide.

Why it would have helped: Reading the analysis of the "Initial 'Bulldog Mode' and its Limitations" would have primed me to be more cautious. Understanding the importance of shifting from a "solution-first" to a "process-oriented" paradigm would have encouraged the kind of deliberate thinking that was needed. It provides the "why" for the methods detailed in the other documents.
