# River Puzzle Solution

This document details the solution to the classic River Puzzle, solved using the `sequentialthinking` tool to simulate and validate each step.

## The Puzzle

A human needs to transport a goat, a cabbage, and a wolf across a river. The constraints are:
*   The boat can only carry the human and one other item at a time.
*   The goat cannot be left alone with the cabbage.
*   The cabbage cannot be left alone with the wolf.
*   The human's presence prevents any danger.

## Approach: Sequential Thinking

The `sequentialthinking` tool was employed to systematically plan and execute the solution. This involved:

1.  **Defining the Puzzle State:** Representing the location of each entity (Human, Goat, Cabbage, Wolf, Boat) as being on the 'L' (Left) or 'R' (Right) side of the river.
    *   **State Representation:** `(Human_Side, Goat_Side, Cabbage_Side, Wolf_Side, Boat_Side)`

2.  **Initial State:** All entities start on the Left side.
    *   `('L', 'L', 'L', 'L', 'L')`

3.  **Goal State:** All entities end on the Right side.
    *   `('R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R')`

4.  **Valid Moves:** The human can take one item (or none) across the river with the boat.

5.  **Invalid States (Constraints):** These are the critical conditions to avoid.
    *   If the Human is NOT present:
        *   Goat and Cabbage are on the same side.
        *   Cabbage and Wolf are on the same side.

6.  **Iterative Simulation:** Each "thought" in the `sequentialthinking` process represented a move, followed by a validation check against the invalid states.

## Solution Steps

Here is the sequence of moves that successfully solves the puzzle:

**Initial State:** `(L, L, L, L, L)`

**Key Decision Point & Backtracking:**

My initial attempt for "Move 1" was to take the Goat to the Right.
*   **Proposed Move 1 (Initial Attempt):** Human takes Goat to the Right.
*   **Resulting State (Left Side):** Cabbage and Wolf are left alone.
*   **Validation:** This immediately violated the "Cabbage and Wolf alone" constraint.

This detection of an invalid state was crucial. Instead of getting "lost" or continuing down a flawed path (akin to a depth-first search without pruning), the `sequentialthinking` tool allowed for explicit **revision**. By using `isRevision=True` and `revisesThought=<thought_number_of_failed_move>`, I was able to correct the strategy and propose a new, valid first move. This demonstrates the tool's ability to facilitate self-correction and prevent getting stuck in unproductive branches of the solution space.

**Corrected Solution Path:**

**Move 1: Human takes Cabbage to the Right.**
*   **State:** `(R, L, R, L, R)`
*   **Validation:** Left side (Goat, Wolf) is safe. Right side (Human, Cabbage) is safe. **Valid.**

**Move 2: Human goes alone back to the Left.**
*   **State:** `(L, L, R, L, L)`
*   **Validation:** Right side (Cabbage) is safe. Left side (Human, Goat, Wolf) is safe. **Valid.**

**Move 3: Human takes Goat to the Right.**
*   **State:** `(R, R, R, L, R)`
*   **Validation:** Left side (Wolf) is safe. Right side (Human, Goat, Cabbage) is safe. **Valid.**

**Move 4: Human takes Goat back to the Left.**
*   **State:** `(L, L, R, L, L)`
*   **Validation:** Right side (Cabbage) is safe. Left side (Human, Goat, Wolf) is safe. **Valid.**
    *   *Note: This returns to a previous valid state, which is sometimes necessary in these puzzles.*

**Move 5: Human takes Wolf to the Right.**
*   **State:** `(R, L, R, R, R)`
*   **Validation:** Left side (Goat) is safe. Right side (Human, Cabbage, Wolf) is safe. **Valid.**

**Move 6: Human takes Cabbage back to the Left.**
*   **State:** `(L, L, L, R, L)`
*   **Validation:** Right side (Wolf) is safe. Left side (Human, Goat, Cabbage) is safe. **Valid.**

**Move 7: Human takes Goat to the Right.**
*   **State:** `(R, R, L, R, R)`
*   **Validation:** Left side (Cabbage) is safe. Right side (Human, Goat, Wolf) is safe. **Valid.**

**Move 8: Human goes alone back to the Left.**
*   **State:** `(L, R, L, R, L)`
*   **Validation:** Right side (Goat, Wolf) is safe. Left side (Human, Cabbage) is safe. **Valid.**

**Move 9: Human takes Cabbage to the Right.**
*   **State:** `(R, R, R, R, R)`
*   **Validation:** All entities are on the Right side. **GOAL STATE REACHED.**

## Conclusion

The River Puzzle was successfully solved in 9 moves. The `sequentialthinking` tool proved invaluable by enforcing a structured approach, allowing for clear state tracking, and critically, enabling explicit self-correction and revision when an invalid path was identified. This iterative and reflective process is highly effective for navigating complex logical problems.
