Puzzle: Sparse Red Spiral
Goal: Write a simple Python function to paint a clockwise red spiral on an n × n grid (n is a positive integer, odd or even), starting from the center. The spiral uses for painted tiles and for unpainted tiles, stops early to leave significant whitespace, and prints the grid after each directional move to show its growth. The solution must be minimal, using a single loop and straightforward logic, avoiding standard spiral patterns or complex structures.
Rules:
Initialize the Grid:
Create an n × n grid filled with (unpainted tiles).
Place one (painted tile) at the center, defined as coordinates (n // 2, n // 2) in standard grid indexing (rows as y, columns as x, so grid[y][x]). For even n, this is the lower-right cell of the central four (e.g., (2, 2) for n=4).
Print this initial grid with the single . This counts as the first painted tile but is not a directional move.
Spiral Movement:
From the center, move in a clockwise cycle: Right → Down → Left → Up, repeating.
For each directional move, attempt k steps, where k starts at 1 and increases by 1 after each move (e.g., 1 step Right, 2 steps Down, 3 steps Left, 4 steps Up, 5 steps Right, …). This is not the standard spiral pattern of paired equal-length moves (e.g., 1, 1, 2, 2, …).
For each step in a move:
Compute the next position based on the current direction (e.g., Right: x += 1, Down: y += 1).
If the position is within bounds (0 ≤ x, y < n), paint it , update the current position, and increment the painted tile count.
If the position is out of bounds, skip the entire move (do not paint any steps), print the current grid, and terminate the spiral.
Combine bounds checking and painting in a single loop; do not pre-validate all steps before painting.
After completing a move (all k steps or none if any step is out of bounds), print the grid.
Termination:
Stop when the number of painted tiles reaches exactly floor(n²/2) + 1 or when any step in the next move would be out of bounds, whichever comes first. Check the painted tile count before starting a new move to avoid painting extra tiles.
Do not attempt partial moves; if any step in a move is out of bounds or the tile limit is reached, skip the entire move and end the spiral.
Print the final grid before exiting.
Output:
Use exactly for painted tiles and for unpainted tiles. Do not use approximations like #, ., , , or Unicode escapes (e.g., '\U0001f7e5').
Print each row as space-separated symbols, with a blank line between grids, ensuring monospaced alignment (e.g., consistent spacing).
Print the grid after the initial center tile and after each directional move (whether steps were painted or the move was skipped).

Constraints:
Input n is a positive integer (e.g., 1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
Stop after painting exactly floor(n²/2) + 1 tiles or when a move is out of bounds, whichever comes first.
Use standard grid indexing: rows as y, columns as x (e.g., grid[y][x] for position (x, y)).
Output must use and directly, with space-separated rows and a blank line between grids.
Use a single main loop for movement and painting, with a direction index cycled via modulo (e.g., direction = (direction + 1) % 4).
Do not check tile state (e.g., “already painted”), as the spiral’s design prevents overlaps.
Notes:
Sparsity is critical: The spiral leaves many cells ; do not fill the grid.
Linear step progression: Steps increase by 1 after each move (1, 2, 3, 4, …), not in pairs (e.g., 1, 1, 2, 2, …). Avoid patterns assuming equal-length moves for opposite directions.
Greedy movement: For each step, check bounds, paint if valid, and update position in one loop iteration. Do not use a separate loop to pre-validate all steps in a move.
Minimalism: Avoid complex data structures (e.g., direction arrays like [(0,1), (1,0), …], move queues, visited sets). Use a single integer for direction (0=Right, 1=Down, 2=Left, 3=Up) and compute next positions inline (e.g., x += 1 for Right).
Exact symbols: Use and directly; other symbols or encodings (e.g., #, ., '\U0001f7e5') are incorrect.
Standard indexing: Treat y as row index and x as column index in grid[y][x], matching common grid conventions.
Termination precision: Check the painted tile count before each move to ensure exactly floor(n²/2) + 1 tiles are painted, avoiding extra tiles or partial moves.
Visual narrative: Printing after each move is mandatory to show the spiral’s evolution.
