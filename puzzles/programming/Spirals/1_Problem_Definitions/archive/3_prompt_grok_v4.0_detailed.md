Objective: Write a Python function red_spiral(n) that creates an n Ã— n grid and paints a sparse, clockwise spiral of red squares () starting from the center, using white squares () as the background. The spiral moves in a sequence of increasing steps (1, 2, 3, â€¦) in directions Right, Down, Left, Up, cycling clockwise, painting exactly floor(nÂ²/2) + 1 tiles. Print the grid after each directional move (or when a move is skipped due to bounds), using space-separated emojis and a blank line between grids.
Requirements:
Input: A positive integer n (e.g., n=5, n=6, n=8), representing the grid size.
Grid Setup:
Create an n Ã— n grid initialized with  (white square emoji, U+2B1C).
Use standard indexing: rows as y, columns as x (e.g., grid[y][x]).
Starting Point:
Begin at the center (floor(n/2), floor(n/2)), e.g., (2, 2) for n=5.
Paint the center with  (red square emoji, U+1F7E5) and count it as one tile.
Print the initial grid.
Spiral Movement:
Move in a clockwise spiral: Right, Down, Left, Up, repeating.
Use a direction indicator (e.g., 0=Right, 1=Down, 2=Left, 3=Up) and cycle it using modulo (e.g., (direction + 1) % 4).
Each move attempts k steps (k=1, 2, 3, â€¦), increasing linearly per move (not paired like Ulam spirals: 1, 1, 2, 2, â€¦).
Compute next positions incrementally (e.g., for Right, x += 1; for Down, y += 1) without direction arrays or complex formulas.
Painting Rules:
For each step, if the position (x, y) is within bounds (0 â‰¤ x, y < n), paint it  and increment the tile count.
The spiralâ€™s path naturally avoids overlaps due to its linear steps and clockwise pattern; no explicit collision checks are needed.
Termination:
Stop when exactly floor(nÂ²/2) + 1 tiles are painted (e.g., 12 for n=5, 19 for n=6, 33 for n=8).
Check the tile limit before starting each move, allowing the final move to complete fully if within bounds.
If a step is out of bounds, print the current grid and terminate without painting further.
Output:
Print the grid after each directional move (e.g., after k steps in one direction) or when a move is skipped due to bounds.
Each grid is printed with space-separated emojis, one row per line, followed by a blank line.
For n=5, expect 6 grids (initial + 5 moves); for n=6, expect 7 grids; for n=8, expect 10 grids.
Constraints:
Use minimal code: avoid imports (e.g., math.floor), direction arrays, flags for validity, or redundant checks.
Prefer Pythonâ€™s integer division (//) for floor operations.
Start the step counter at 0 and increment it to achieve moves of 1, 2, 3, â€¦ steps.
Use a single loop structure with nested steps, combining bounds checking and painting greedily.
Assume n is a positive integer; no input validation required.

Test Cases:
red_spiral(5): 12 tiles, 6 grids, as above.
red_spiral(6): 19 tiles, 7 grids, ending in a partial top-row turn.
red_spiral(8): 33 tiles, 10 grids, ending in a full top-row turn.
Hints:
Use a single while loop for moves, with a nested for loop for steps.
Initialize the step counter at 0, incrementing it to start moves at 1 step.
Terminate with return on out-of-bounds or break after reaching the tile limit, avoiding validity flags.
Trust the spiralâ€™s path to avoid overlaps due to its linear, clockwise design.
Use // for integer division to compute the tile limit without imports.
Print after each move or on termination, ensuring the correct grid count.
Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
Do not use Ulam spiral steps (1, 1, 2, 2, â€¦).
Avoid direction arrays (e.g., [(1, 0), (0, 1), â€¦]); use incremental updates (x += 1, y += 1).
Do not stop mid-move when the tile limit is reached; complete the move if within bounds.
Avoid redundant checks for painted tiles, as the spiralâ€™s path is unique.
Do not use imports like math.floor or extra flags for move validity.
Do not print per step (e.g., 13 grids for n=5); print per move (6 grids for n=5).
