Draw this resulting spiral so that it spirals out in the opposite direction:


🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥
🟥⬜⬜⬜⬜
🟥⬜🟥🟥⬜
🟥⬜⬜🟥⬜
🟥🟥🟥🟥⬜


Answers:

You can think of the “🟥” emoji as a character in a story that’s navigating through a labyrinth. Depending on the direction of the spiral (clockwise or counterclockwise), our character moves through the labyrinth, leaving a trail (“🟥”) behind. The remaining space in the labyrinth is represented by the “⬜” emoji. This narrative approach can make it easier to visualize and understand the pattern. 


Identify the Starting Point: The original spiral started from the top left corner. To reverse the pattern, I imagined the spiral starting from the top right corner instead.
Change the Direction: The original spiral spiraled inward in a clockwise direction. To reverse the pattern, I imagined the spiral spiraling inward in a counterclockwise direction.
Visualize the Path: With the new starting point and direction, I visualized the path of the spiral. This involved imagining the “🟥” emoji moving from the top right corner to the left, then down, then to the right, and so on, in a counterclockwise direction.
Visualize the Colors: I then visualized the colors of the emojis along the path of the spiral. The “🟥” emoji forms the path of the spiral, while the “⬜” emoji fills the rest of the space.
