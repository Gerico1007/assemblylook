Solution leftwards

Spiral Leftwards:
Start from the top right corner of the matrix.
Initialize the step size to the matrix size.
Begin moving in a leftward direction, filling the matrix with the desired elements.
After completing a leftward movement, decrement the step size.
Change the direction to downward and continue filling the matrix.
Repeat the leftward and downward movements, decrementing the step size until the entire matrix is filled.
