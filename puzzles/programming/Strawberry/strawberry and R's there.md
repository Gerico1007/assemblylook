## Needed intro:

FYI, illeisms below to make it clear who is who, in our list of the parties hereinto. But later you can use regular pronouns. 

### Intro: 

The user wishes for the model to understand that the user welcomes clarifying questions from the model regarding its interpretation, or if the model perceives ambiguities in the puzzle itself. Should the model identify multiple interpretations, it is encouraged to ask for clarification or explain its different understandings to ensure mutual alignment. This approach assists the model in delivering the most accurate and insightful solution. The user now awaits the model's readiness for the puzzle.

### Puzzle:
In the string "strawberry", how many times does the letter 'r' appear?  
A. Answer it yourself, "in your head" by counting. 
B. Code it and run it. 
C. Describe how you counted as per A and B, how come you used that heuristic.
