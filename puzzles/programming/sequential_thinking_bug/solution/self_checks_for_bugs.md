   Investigation Plan & Results                                               
                                                                              
  This document outlines the steps taken to diagnose the  sequentialthinking  
  tool, and the final results after updating the Gemini CLI.                  
                                                                              
  ## Initial Investigation (Legacy Issue)                                     
                                                                              
  The tool was originally failing with an  "Invalid thoughtNumber: must be a  
  number"  error. The investigation determined that the Gemini CLI environment
  was using a cached, older version of the tool, preventing a patched version 
  ( 0.6.3 ) from running.                                                     
                                                                              
  ## Current Test (July 11, 2025)                                             
                                                                              
  A new test was conducted to verify the tool's functionality with the updated
  Gemini CLI.                                                                 
                                                                              
  1. Test Execution:                                                          
    • Action: Use the  sequentialthinking  tool to perform the simple task:   
    "make a cup of tea".                                                      
    • Result: The tool successfully completed the multi-step thinking process 
    without any errors. All thoughts were processed correctly, and the final  
    answer was reached. This confirms the original environmental issue is     
    resolved.                                                                 
  2. Conclusion:                                                              
    • Result: The  sequentialthinking  tool is now fully functional. The      
    previous failure was due to an environmental issue in an older version of 
    the Gemini CLI, which has been fixed in the current version.              
                                                                              
                                                                              
  ## Final Root Cause Analysis                                                
                                                                              
  The investigation concluded with a precise understanding of the original    
  failure:                                                                    
                                                                              
  The error was not a simple caching issue but a subtle, multi-stage          
  dependency                                                                  
  conflict within the local Gemini CLI application.                           
                                                                              
  1. The Culprit: The  package.json  for the Gemini CLI specified a dependency
  on  @google/genai  with a version range ( ^1.8.0 ). This allowed an         
  automatic update to a new minor version,  1.9.0 .                           
  2. The Breaking Change: Version  1.9.0  of  @google/genai  introduced a     
  breaking change in how it handled the schemas for tool function declarations.
  3. The Silent Failure: Because of this change, the Gemini CLI app failed to 
  correctly process the arguments for tool calls. When the cloud-based AI     
  Engine sent a valid request, the local CLI would silently corrupt the       
  parameters before forwarding them.                                          
  4. The Misleading Error: The CLI sent these corrupted arguments to the      
  sequentialthinking  MCP (Managed Cloud Platform). The MCP, upon receiving   
  invalid data (specifically for  thoughtNumber ), would then generate the    
  murky  "Invalid thoughtNumber: must be a number"  error. The error's origin 
  made it difficult to trace back to the true root cause in the CLI's         
  dependency tree.                                                            
                                                                              
  The issue was resolved by pinning the  @google/genai  dependency to the     
  exact, stable version  1.8.0  in the Gemini CLI, which is present in the    
  current version.                                                            
                                                                              
  ## Environment Information                                                  
                                                                              
  ### Gemini CLI Version                                                      
                                                                              
   0.1.11                               


   Final Report:  sequentialthinking  Tool Investigation                      
                                                                              
  Date: 2025-07-10                                                            
                                                                              
  ## 1. Overview                                                              
                                                                              
  This report details the investigation into a persistent failure of the      
  sequentialthinking  tool. Despite a code patch being applied and the tool   
  being recompiled, it continued to fail with an error indicating an older    
  version was being used.                                                     
                                                                              
  ## 2. The Problem                                                           
                                                                              
  The  sequentialthinking  tool repeatedly failed with the following error:   
                                                                              
   "Invalid thoughtNumber: must be a number"                                  
                                                                              
  This occurred even when valid parameters were provided, suggesting a data   
  type mismatch where numbers were being passed as strings.                   
                                                                              
  ## 3. Investigation and Findings                                            
                                                                              
  The investigation followed a logical progression of steps to diagnose the   
  root cause:                                                                 
                                                                              
  1. Initial Failure: The tool failed during initial testing.                 
  2. Code Analysis: A review of  sequential_thinking_fix_report.md  revealed  
  that a patch had been developed to address this exact issue by parsing      
  string inputs into numbers. The patched version was identified as  0.6.3 .  
  3. Confirmation of Environmental Issue: Despite the existence of the patch, 
  the tool continued to fail with the old error message. This strongly        
  suggested that the execution environment was not using the updated code.    
  4. Verification of Local Version: The  package.json  file for the local     
  sequentialthinking  server confirmed that the code on disk was indeed the   
  patched version  0.6.3 .                                                    
  5. Exclusion of Standard Installation Methods: An  npm list -g  command     
  confirmed that the tool was not installed as a standard global Node.js      
  package, ruling out a simple version conflict in the global  node_modules   
  directory.                                                                  
                                                                              
  ## 4. Root Cause Analysis                                                   
                                                                              
  The evidence gathered leads to a single conclusion: the issue is            
  environmental. The Gemini CLI's tool execution framework is not invoking the
  locally compiled, patched version of the  sequentialthinking  server.       
  Instead, it is routing the calls to a cached, "hard-wired," or otherwise    
  managed instance of the tool that is an older, un-patched version.          
                                                                              
  The inability to inspect or modify this internal tool cache prevents a      
  direct resolution.                                                          
                                                                              
  ## 5. Conclusion                                                            
                                                                              
  The  sequentialthinking  tool is failing due to an environmental            
  configuration issue within the Gemini CLI platform. The code fix is present 
  and correct in the local files but is not being utilized by the live        
  environment. The problem lies in the tool invocation and management system, 
  which is beyond the scope of this investigation to modify.
