### Task: Phrase-Level Rhetorical Sentiment and Neutrality Analysis (Style-First)

**Objective:**
Disregard factual content. Extract key evaluative, ideological, or sentiment-bearing phrases, collocations, and lexical choices from the text. Analyze these exclusively for tone, connotation, and stance, identifying whether each phrase is neutral, positively loaded, or negatively loaded. Highlight the rhetorical effects and "vibes" the style projects, including any subtle persuasion, valorization, mitigation, or framing bias embedded in the language.

**Steps:**

1. Identify all prominent phrases or expressions that carry evaluative or ideological weight (e.g., “advocate for,” “landmark achievement,” “pivotal figure”).
2. For each phrase, assess:

   * Sentiment polarity (positive, neutral, negative)
   * Connotative nuance (progressive, authoritative, celebratory, cautious, etc.)
   * Rhetorical stance (valorizing, mitigating, neutral, critical)
3. Summarize the overall stylistic “vibe” projected by the aggregate of such phrases (e.g., overwhelmingly positive, cautiously balanced, subtly valorizing).
4. Do not consider factual content, accuracy, or completeness. Focus strictly on style and rhetorical impact.
