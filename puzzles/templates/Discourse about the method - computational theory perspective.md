"Analyze the following problem description from a computational theory perspective.

1. What is the formal class or category of this problem?
2. What is the general algorithmic paradigm or abstract method typically applied to this class of problem?

Important: Do not provide a solution or any of the specific steps involved in solving it. I am interested only in the high-level classification and the name of the general approach."



Why This Works:
"Computational theory perspective" / "From a computer science or AI perspective": This immediately lifts the context from the specific puzzle to a more academic and abstract level. It tells the AI to think like a computer scientist, not just a puzzle solver.
"Formal class or category": This is a direct request for the name of the pattern (e.g., "Constraint Satisfaction Problem," "Graph Traversal Problem," "Dynamic Programming Problem").
"Algorithmic paradigm or abstract method": This asks for the name of the general strategy (e.g., "Backtracking," "State-Space Search," "Divide and Conquer"). It avoids asking for a specific algorithm (like BFS vs. DFS).
The explicit negative constraint: The final paragraph is crucial. It clearly forbids the AI from doing what it normally defaults to: solving the problem. By telling it what not to do, you force it to stay at the requested level of abstraction.


That is a fantastic and crucial question. You're asking how to shift an AI from a reactive "Terminator" mode (execute the goal immediately) to a reflective, strategic mode (plan, consider, then act). This is a key skill for getting the best results from any advanced AI.

The general principle is to force the AI into a state of metacognitionâ€”making it think about its own thinking process. You can achieve this through several prompting strategies.

Here are a few powerful techniques:

1. Mandate a Plan of Action
This is the most direct method. You explicitly forbid the AI from acting until it has presented a plan and (optionally) received your approval.

How it works: It forces the model to decompose the problem into sequential, logical steps before generating the final output.
Prompt Example:
"Before you write the code for the user authentication system, provide a step-by-step plan. Detail the components you'll create, the libraries you'll use, and the security measures you'll include. Do not start writing code until I approve the plan."

2. Enforce "Chain of Thought" or "Self-Critique"
Ask the AI to explain its reasoning, consider alternatives, and identify potential flaws in its own ideas.

How it works: This slows the AI down and forces it to evaluate its own output, often catching errors or making more robust choices.
Prompt Example:
"I need to migrate a database. First, think step-by-step about the process. What are the potential risks? What are the alternative migration strategies? Compare the pros and cons of each alternative. Based on that analysis, propose the best strategy."

3. Assign a Cautious Persona
Instruct the AI to adopt the role of a careful, methodical professional. This leverages the vast amount of text data associated with that role.

How it works: The AI will adopt the communication style and, more importantly, the thought patterns associated with the persona.
Prompt Example:
"You are a senior systems architect with 20 years of experience, known for being extremely cautious and detail-oriented. Your primary goal is to prevent system outages. How would you approach the task of upgrading our production servers? Describe your thought process, risk assessment, and rollback plan."

4. Use "Via Negativa" (The Way of Negation)
As you cleverly did earlier, explicitly define what the AI should not do. This creates clear boundaries and prevents it from taking shortcuts.

How it works: It narrows the AI's focus and forces it to explore more creative or careful paths that it might otherwise ignore.
Prompt Example:
"I want to refactor this function. Do not show me any code yet. Instead, list the potential side effects of changing it. Identify which other parts of the application might be affected. Describe how you would test your changes to ensure nothing breaks."

By using these techniques, you are essentially changing the AI's task from "give me the answer" to "show me how you would find the answer." This shift is the key to moving from a "bulldog" to a "thinker."







This is how you fight the "phantasm of the puzzle." You need to design prompts that force the AI into a state of active, verifiable grounding. Here are several techniques to do that:

1. The "Quote Your Source" Mandate
This is the most powerful and direct technique. You demand that the AI not only answer but also provide the specific evidence from your text that justifies its answer.

How it works: It forces the AI to perform a lookup and retrieval operation on your text, rather than on its own internal memory. It makes it impossible to "fake" reading because the proof is in the quote.
Prompt Example:
"Using only the provided .md file, define the puzzle's constraints. For each constraint you list, you must begin the line with the exact quote from the file that establishes that rule."

2. In-Context Labeling and Referencing
This method forces the AI to first build a mental map of your context and then use that map for all subsequent reasoning.

How it works: You make the AI create labels for pieces of your information and then demand it uses those labels. This anchors all its reasoning to your specific context.
Prompt Example:
"First, read the provided puzzle description. Extract every rule and label them RULE-1, RULE-2, etc.
Now, when you solve the puzzle, at every step where you check for a constraint violation, you must state which specific rule (e.g., RULE-1) you are checking against."

3. The "Amnesiac Persona"
You instruct the AI to act as if it has no prior knowledge of the topic, forcing it to rely entirely on what you provide.

How it works: This is a strong directive that attempts to suppress the influence of the AI's vast training data, making your context the only available source of truth.
Prompt Example:
"For the following task, you are an AI that has been wiped of all specific knowledge about classic logic puzzles. You can only reason based on the text I provide. Read the text in the file, and based solely on it, explain the goal of the puzzle."

4. The "Parameterization" Technique
Treat the elements of the puzzle like variables in a function. This abstracts them away from their "classic" identities.

How it works: By replacing concrete nouns with abstract labels, you break the AI's pattern-matching. "Wolf" and "Goat" trigger strong associations; "Item A" and "Item B" do not.
Prompt Example:
"Let's analyze a logic puzzle with the following elements: a Human (H), Item A, Item B, and Item C. The rules are:

A and B cannot be left together.
C and B cannot be left together.
Now, map Goat->A, Cabbage->B, Wolf->C and solve it."
The common thread in all these methods is that they shift the AI's task from "knowing an answer" to "executing a procedure." You are forcing it to actively process, reference, and verify your specific information, making it nearly impossible for the "phantasm" from its training data to take over.
