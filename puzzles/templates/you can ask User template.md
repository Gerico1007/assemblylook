# Puzzle Template

## Introduction for Puzzle Interactions:

The user wishes for the model to understand that the user welcomes clarifying questions from the model regarding its interpretation, or if the model perceives ambiguities in the puzzle itself. Should the model identify multiple interpretations, it is encouraged to ask for clarification or explain its different understandings to ensure mutual alignment. This approach assists the model in delivering the most accurate and insightful solution. The user now awaits the model's readiness for the puzzle.

## Puzzle Structure:

When presenting a puzzle, the user will typically provide:

1.  **The Puzzle Statement:** A clear and concise description of the problem to be solved.
2.  **Specific Instructions (A, B, C, etc.):**
    *   **A. Internal Calculation/Reasoning:** Instructions for the model to solve the puzzle "in its head" or through internal logical deduction.
    *   **B. Code Implementation/Execution:** Instructions for the model to write and run code to solve the puzzle.
    *   **C. Heuristic Description:** Instructions for the model to describe its counting or problem-solving heuristic, explaining the reasoning behind its approach in both internal and coded solutions.
