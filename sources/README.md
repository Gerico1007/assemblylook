*   **`historical_texts`**: This directory contains historical documents, such as speeches and essays, that are used in the rhetoric and reading comprehension puzzles.
*   **`miscellaneous`**: This directory contains a variety of texts that don't fit into the other categories.

*   **`proverbs`**: This directory contains collections of proverbs and other short sayings that are used in the language and logic puzzles.
