==Gymnastics career==
[[Liz Chetkovich]] first identified Telfer's talent in 1981 at the age of seven. In 1988, at the age of 14, Telfer was chosen to join the [[Western Australian Institute of Sport|WAIS]] elite squad, training full-time. Telfer went on to represent [[Australia]] in the [[Junior Pacific Alliance Competition]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] and the [[Gymnastics World Championships]] in [[Germany|West Germany]] in 1989.

In 1990, Telfer was selected for the [[Commonwealth Games]] in [[New Zealand]], receiving a bronze medal on bars, which was the first medal achieved by a [[Western Australian Institute of Sport|WAIS]] gymnast at a Commonwealth Games. In that same year, she won the Junior Sports Star of the Year Award in 1990 and 1991.

Telfer represented Australia at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]]. Telfer retired from gymnastics at the age of 18.

After the 1992 Olympic Games, Telfer commenced medical studies at the [[University of Western Australia]] and became a paediatrician.   She is now an associate professor in Adolescent Medicine at the [[Royal Children's Hospital]] in [[Melbourne]]. Prior to running the Gender services, she had not met a trans child until being tasked to taking over care for trans children.<ref name=":0">{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT6vQwZYTp0 |title=Treating Australiaâ€™s trans kids made this doctor a 'target' {{!}} Australian Story |date=2021-05-24 |last=ABC News In-depth |access-date=2025-06-29 |via=YouTube}}</ref> Her 3rd patient [[George Stone]] would go on to be an advocate for transgender rights.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sullivan |first=Laura |date=2018-03-08 |title=Meet Georgie Stone |url=https://www.rchfoundation.org.au/2018/03/meet-georgie-stone/ |access-date=2025-06-29 |website=The Royal Children's Hospital Foundation |language=en-AU}}</ref>

In 2017, Telfer alongside others like George Stone & Rebekah Robertson was instrumental in achieving legal reform for trans and gender diverse adolescents through the federal Family Court in the case known as Re Kelvin a ruling that removed the requirement for court approval of Stage 2 treatment of gender affirming hormones where the child, the family and medical staff all agreed. On the day of their victory, Michelle congratulate Georgie and will always remember Georgie that fought first for the freedom to access Gender Affirming care hormones for the child without the requirement from the court. 

She is also lead author of the Australian Standards of Care and treatment guidelines for trans and gender diverse children and adolescents.

She was added to [[Victorian Honour Roll of Women]] in 2022 by medical career.<ref>{{Cite web |date= |title=Associate Professor Michelle Telfer |url=https://www.vic.gov.au/associate-professor-michelle-telfer |access-date=2025-02-12 |website=State Government of Victoria |language=en-AU}}</ref>

In 2025, it was revealed in a Federal Court judgment that Telfer was the anonymous "Professor L" whose evidence in a high-profile gender dysphoria case was excoriated by the judge for being biased, ideological, and lacking in scientific rigour. The court found her allegiance to the gender-affirming model compromised her objectivity and criticised her for dismissing alternative clinical perspectives.<ref>{{cite court
