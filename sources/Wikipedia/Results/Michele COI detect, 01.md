✅ **7️⃣ Decide COI Probability**

**Raw verdict:**
**High probability** of conflict-of-interest authorship or strong self-authorship fingerprints.
Let’s unpack the forensic chain of evidence:

---

### 🔬 **Indicators pointing to COI or self-authorship**

**1️⃣ Direct interiority & private perspective**

* *“Michelle congratulate Georgie and will always remember Georgie…”*
  ➜ This line reads like personal reminiscence — not neutral third-party reportage.
  ➜ Such statements are either unverifiable *or* should be attributed to a direct quote in a reliable source — not presented as narrative fact.
  ➜ BLPs must never presume knowledge of a living subject’s thoughts without citation. This is classic WP\:OR and WP\:COI overlap.

---

**2️⃣ Heroic framing + emotional spin**

* *“On the day of their victory…”*, *“fought first for the freedom…”*
  ➜ Loaded phrasing that champions the subject’s cause. This is not encyclopedic summary — it’s narrative advocacy.
  ➜ When unsourced, valorizing language strongly suggests the hand of someone personally invested — the subject, an ally, or an advocate.
  ➜ Wikipedia policy requires even *positive* bias to be scrubbed if not supported by reliable, independent sourcing.

---

**3️⃣ Tense shifts & narrative closeness**

* The glitch *“Michelle congratulate Georgie…”* is not just sloppy style; it’s the mark of a statement crossing from detached narration into quasi-testimonial mode.
  ➜ These tense slips often appear when the author is too close to the subject — they’re “remembering” or retelling in the present, not observing from an editorial distance.

---

**4️⃣ Incomplete sourcing of praise claims**

* *“Instrumental in achieving legal reform…”* is the kind of claim that should be rigorously backed by multiple third-party news reports or court documents.
  ➜ When it appears in a BLP without explicit sourcing, it’s often because the only person who knows or asserts it is the subject or their close supporters.

---

### 🧩 **Counter-weight: Negative detail**

The text *does* contain a harsh factual bit:

> *“... revealed in a Federal Court judgment that Telfer was the anonymous ‘Professor L’ … excoriated for being biased, ideological…”*

✅ This is robustly sourced and runs *against* the subject’s image, which lowers the probability of pure whitewashing.
However: it does not eliminate the self-authorship scent in the other passages — more likely, the critical bit was added by a different editor or court doc insertion. The personal tone elsewhere is still suspect.

---

### ⚖️ **Verdict**

**➡️  Overall COI Probability: High**

* Narrative voice crosses the line from third-person summary to semi-first-person interiority.
* Heroic framing and emotional language are classic signs of partiality.
* Specific phrases indicate a privileged vantage point unlikely for a neutral editor.
* At least one passage strongly violates verifiability (private memory).

In short: **a neutral editor wouldn’t know or assert “will always remember Georgie”** — only Telfer herself or an insider would.
So the text should be presumed compromised under WP\:COI heuristics.

---

### ✅ **Why so**

Because **verifiability**, **neutrality**, and **no original research** (the triad that governs BLP) are all breached simultaneously by:

* unverifiable private thoughts
* subjective heroism
* style echoing an advocate’s voice rather than a disinterested narrator.

If you find a text that looks like a press release or self-reflection — it probably *is*.
Wikipedia’s defense is to demand cited, independent confirmation or to purge the material.

---

**Recommended editorial action:**

* Remove unverifiable interior statements.
* Reframe any “victory” or “instrumental” claims with hard, attributed sources.
* Watchlist for recurring COI edits.
* If repeated, tag or escalate for admin scrutiny under WP\:COI or possible autobiography.

---

**This concludes Step ✅ 7️⃣ — all flags point to: *High COI likelihood*.**
