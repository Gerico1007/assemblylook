[Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] Such there may be, and, for the sake of their example, would that there were more! [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] In calling them "fanatics," you cast contumely upon the noble army of martyrs, from the earliest day down to this hour; upon the great tribunes of human rights, by whom life, liberty, and happiness, on earth, have been secured; upon the long line of devoted patriots who, throughout history, have truly loved their country; and upon all who, in noble aspirations for the general good and in forgetfulness of self, have stood out before their age, and gathered into their generous bosoms the shafts of tyranny and wrong, in order to make a pathway for truth. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] You discredit Luther, when alone he nailed his articles to the door of the church at Wittenberg, and then, to the imperial demand that he should retract, firmly replied, "Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God!" [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] You discredit Hampden, when alone he refused to pay the few shillings of ship-money, and shook the throne of Charles I; you discredit Milton, when, amidst the corruptions of a heartless court, he lived on, the lofty friend of liberty, above question or suspicion; you discredit Russell and Sidney, when, for the sake of their country, they calmly turned from family and friends, to tread the narrow steps of the scaffold; you discredit those early founders of American institutions, who preferred the hardships of a wilderness, surrounded by a savage foe, to injustice on beds of ease; you discredit our later fathers, who, few in numbers and weak in resources, yet strong in their cause, did not hesitate to brave the mighty power of England, already encircling the globe with her morning drum-beats. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] Yes, sir, of such are the fanatics of history, according to the senator. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] But I tell that senator, that there are characters badly eminent, of whose fanaticism there can be no question. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Such were the ancient Egyptians, who worshipped divinities in brutish forms; the Druids, who darkened the forests of oak, in which they lived, by sacrifices of blood; the Mexicans, who surrendered countless victims to the propitiation of their obscene idols; the Spaniards, who under Alva, sought to force the inquisition upon Holland, by a tyranny kindred to that now employed to force Slavery upon Kansas; and such were the Algerines, when in solemn conclave, after listening to a speech not unlike that of the senator from South Carolina, they resolved to continue the slavery of white Christians, and to extend it to the countrymen of Washington. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] Aye, sir, extend it! [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] And in this same dreary catalogue faithful history must record all who now, in an enlightened age and in a land of boasted Freedom, stand up, in perversion of the constitution and in denial of immortal truth, to fasten a new shackle upon their fellow-man.

< Its character was still further apparent in the general structure of the bill. Amidst overflowing professions of regard for the sovereignty of the people in the Territory, they were despoiled of every essential privilege of sovereignty. [Contrasts and Juxtaposition 🔗] They were not allowed to choose their Governor, Secretary, chief justice, associate justices, attorney, or marshal — all of whom are sent from Washington; nor were they allowed to regulate the salaries of any of these functionaries, or the daily allowance of the legislative body, or even the pay of the clerks and door-keepers; but they were left free to adopt slavery. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] And this was called popular sovereignty! [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] Time does not allow, nor does the occasion require, that I should stop to dwell on this transparent device to cover a transcendent wrong. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Suffice it to say, that slavery is in itself an arrogant denial of human rights, and by no human reason can the power to establish such a wrong be placed among the attributes of any just sovereignty. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] In refusing it such a place, I do not deny popular rights, but uphold them; I do not restrain popular rights, but extend them. [Emotional Appeals (Pathos) 😢] And, sir, to this conclusion you must yet come, unless deaf, not only to the admonitions of political justice, but also to the genius of our own constitution, under which, when properly interpreted, no valid claim for slavery can be set up anywhere in the national territory. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] The senator from Michigan (Mr. CASS) may say, in response to the senator from Mississippi, (Mr. BROWN) that slavery cannot go into the territory under the Constitution, without legislative introduction; and permit me to add, in response to both, that slavery cannot go there at all. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Nothing can come out of nothing; and there is absolutely nothing in the constitution out of which slavery can be derived, while there are provisions, which, when properly interpreted, make its existence anywhere within the exclusive national jurisdiction impossible. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭]
< The offensive provision in the bill was, in its form, a legislative anomaly, utterly wanting the natural directness and simplicity of an honest transaction. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] It did not undertake openly to repeal the old prohibition of slavery, but seemed to mince the matter, as if conscious of the swindle. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] It is said that this prohibition, "being inconsistent with the principle of non-intervention by Congress with slavery in the States and territories, as recognised by the legislation of 1850, commonly called the compromise measures, is hereby declared inoperative and void." [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Thus, with insidious ostentation, was it pretended that an act, violating the greatest compromise of our legislative history, and setting loose the foundations of all compromise, was derived out of a compromise. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] Then followed in the bill the further declaration, which is entirely without precedent, and which has been aptly called "a stump speech in its belly," namely: "it being the true intent and meaning of this act, not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefore, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the constitution of the United States." [Diction and Language Choices 📝] Here were smooth words, such as belong to a cunning tongue enlisted in a bad cause. [Irony and Sarcasm 🙃] But whatever may have been their various hidden meanings, this at least was evident, that, by their effect, the congressional prohibition of slavery, which had always been regarded as a seven-fold shield, covering the whole Louisiana Territory north of 36 deg. 30', was now removed, while a principle was declared, which would render the supplementary prohibition of slavery in Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington, "inoperative and void," and thus open to slavery all these vast regions, now the rude cradles of mighty states. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] Here you see the magnitude of the mischief contemplated. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] But my purpose now is with the crime against Kansas, and I shall not stop to expose the conspiracy beyond. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫]

< But this was speedily followed by other developments. The bare-faced scheme was soon whispered that Kansas must be a slave State. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] In conformity with this idea was the Government of this unhappy Territory organized in all its departments; and thus did the President, by whose complicity the prohibition of slavery had been overthrown, lend himself to a new complicity—giving to the conspirators a lease of connivance, amounting even to copartnership. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] The governor, secretary, chief justice, associate justices, attorney, and marshal, with a whole caucus of other stipendaries, nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, were all commended as friendly to Slavery. [Diction and Language Choices 📝] No man with the sentiments of Washington, or Jefferson, or Franklin, found any favor; [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] nor is it too much to say, that had these great patriots once more come among us, not one of them, with his recorded unretracted opinions on slavery, could have been nominated by the President or confirmed by the Senate for any post in that Territory. [Ethical Appeals (Ethos) 🧭] With such auspices the conspiracy proceeded. [Denigration and Invective Language 🚫] Even in advance of the Nebraska bill, secret societies were organized in Missouri ostensibly to protect her institutions; and afterwards, under the name of "Self-Defensive Associations," and of "Blue Lodges," these were multiplied throughout the western counties of that State; before any counter movement from the North. [Historical and Cultural References 🏛️] It was confidently anticipated, that, by the activity of these societies, and the interest of slaveholders everywhere, with the advantage derived from the neighborhood of Missouri, and the influence of the Territorial government, slavery might be introduced into Kansas, quietly but surely, without arousing a conflict—that the crocodile egg might be stealthily dropped in the sun-burnt soil, there to be hatched, unobserved until it sent forth its reptile monster.
