INTRODUCTION: Hi. I’m Georgie Stone, an actor on Neighbours. I first appeared on Australian Story five years ago to share my own story of being a transgender teenager. But I couldn’t have made it to where I am today without the doctor who offered me the chance of a much brighter future. Michelle Telfer is a medical pioneer from Melbourne’s Royal Children’s Hospital who’s fought hard to continue the work she does for hundreds of people like me.

(Family walk)

Michelle Telfer: I remember turning around when we were when we were walking  and there was this black cloud coming and I thought we will be alright.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: I've always wanted to be a mum.

(Family walk)

Lewis: Rain. Rainbows

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: I've got two children, there's Sylvie, who is 13 and Lois who's 10, they're very different children.

(Family walk)

Lewis: And Silvie wanted fish and chips

Michelle: And how long did we have to walk to get fish and chips

Silvie: Another half an hour

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: Kids give you so much to you and I love the way they are so frank and so honest.

(Family walk)

Michelle: But it was worth it, wasn’t it?

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: If Silvio or Lewis came home one day and said that they were trans or that they wanted to transition. I think as a parent I'd be very worried for them about how they might be treated in the world, how they're going to go at school. Are they going to have trouble being discriminated against in terms of jobs?

What I've learnt from looking after trans kids is that despite the fact you want to do absolutely everything you can to protect them, actually the best way to protect them is to allow them to be themselves.

SARAH MCNAB, DIR GENERAL MEDICINE, RCH MELBOURNE: Michelle's work at the Children's Hospital has not been without controversy.  It is new and it is something that some people don’t understand.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: There’s always been critics, and you don't go into this area of medicine without being warned about becoming a target and I've certainly made myself a very big target.

ISABELLE LANGLEY: I really don’t understand the criticisms of Michelle and the hospital. No child would ever choose to do this. It is really hard being a trans kid.

SARAH MCNAB, DIR GENERAL MEDICINE, RCH MELBOURNE: At one point I thought Michelle might stop her work and I thought she might break and just decide that she'd had enough.

ANGUS GRANT, MICHELLE’S PARTNER: I've never felt that Michelle would cave in and this is a girl at 16 was standing on a beam. You know, doing ridiculous physical feats she's used to pressure. But there's no option, you can't not fight, you cant give in

REBEKAH ROBERTSON, TRANSCEND FAMILY AND PEER SUPPORT: I don't think it's a wise idea to ever underestimate Michelle Telfer. Michelle Telfer has learnt from a very young age, discipline, poise, strength, flexibility. That character that she has come to the fore.

TITLE: A BALANCING ACT

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: I was five when I started gymnastics as just a kid in the suburbs of Perth.

LIZ CHEKTOVICH, GYMNASTIC COACH: Michelle was a bit of a surprise athlete for me when I picked her up at first there were numbers of other girls who I thought were much more physically talented than her but she just kept on working hard.

You could just see that that determination behind her — a bit steely in a way.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: I just loved it.  I love the physicality of it. I love the artistry of it. It   never bothered me that I wasn't the best or the strongest or the quickest.

Michelle Telfer: Individually I want to make it to the 1992 Olympics ..that’s the far gaol.

Commentator: First up is Michelle Telfer from Perth.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE:  I've just turned 16 when I went to the Auckland Commonwealth Games

LIZ CHEKTOVICH, GYMNASTIC COACH: And it was it was an extraordinary experience/ for her and she won a bronze medal on the uneven bars.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: I was 18 when I retired from gymnastics that was at Barcelona and then went back to school to finish year 12 that year.

LIZ CHEKTOVICH, GYMNASTIC COACH: She missed a lot of school. I think she sat her final examinations and absolutely sailed through them. She was extraordinary.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: In my final year of gymnastics, I spent so much time with the sports physicians because I had a lot of injuries and I saw the power of what they could do, and that made me want to go on to be a doctor.

ASSOC. PROFESSOR MICHELLE TELFER, MELBOURNE’S ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL: I was trying to decide between doing paediatrics or doing psychiatry and then in paediatrics, I found adolescent medicine, which is that perfect combination of paediatrics and mental health. So I felt once I found adolescent medicine that I'd found the place I wanted to be.

Grant: Lewis are you ready? Are you dressed? You are not on that – you’re on your notepad

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: I think most men would be quite threatened to be with someone who has a career like mine, but Angus has never seemed bothered by it.

Angus Grant: What do you want for breakfast?

Sylvie: An English muffin.

Angus: English. Alright can you do lunch?

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: I first met Angus at a 30th birthday party.

ANGUS GRANT, MICHELLE’S PARTNER: I had been hosting a concert for a friend and I'm showing off on stage. My main job is as a high school teacher and I conduct an ensemble at Victorian Opera.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: I saw him speaking in Japanese and singing opera, and I was really quite taken.

ANGUS GRANT, MICHELLE’S PARTNER: she instigated everything she said, let's go for a drink and we got on very well obviously there was a connection.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: the issue came up about how much I love my work. And I've never really been sure how I was going to make it work to have children and have my career continue. And he responded by saying, I'll stay home and look after your children.

ANGUS GRANT, MICHELLE’S PARTNER: I get to be a trophy husband and, um, you know, bask in her success, and find actually a lot of people are of often jealous that I've been working part time or spending more time with the kids.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE:  2012 was a really big turning point in my career. I came back from maternity leave, and I took this full-time job as the clinical lead of adolescent medicine at the Royal Children's Hospital.

DR SARAH MCNAB, DIR. OF GENERAL MEDICINE, MELBOURNE CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL: Michelle leads a team of 50 people and the services are very broad. So she looks after young, people who are in hospital with eating disorders or self-harm. And they also have an outreach medical service where they look after marginalised and homeless children. And alongside all of that, she runs the gender service.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE:  I was asked to take over this group of trans children in their care and I jumped at it.

Michelle: Come in Ollie

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: I'd never met a trans child before I started this job. And one of the first children I saw was a young boy called Oliver. And I said to Oliver, ‘How do you how do you know that you're a boy? Like, when did you start thinking about yourself as a boy?’. And he was 10 at the time that he told me this story.

OLIVER KIPNIS: For as long as I could remember, any time I had a birthday or even like if someone said, well, what would be your three wishes with a genie, any time I had a blow out the candles or anything like that, I'd always wish that I would be a boy. That would be my birthday wish.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: And it was such a beautiful story and I thought, ‘I can help. I can help this child have a boy's body’. And how many people can do that?

OLIVER KIPNIS: The idea that that was even remotely possible was just incredibly exciting and almost overwhelming to me, because that was something that I had dreamt of for as long as I could remember.

Michelle: Have you had any problems with the injections?

Oliver: No not really. It’s come pretty routine

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: with the consent of both of Oliver's parents, he went on to start testosterone treatment at the age of 15 but we don't provide any surgery. To access surgery, one has to enter the adult system and that only occurs once someone's over the age of 18.

Michelle: I remember when you were little you really, really didn’t like needles

OLIVER KIPNIS: I'm 18 now. I'm in my final year of high school. I'm hoping one day to study medicine, become a cardiothoracic surgeon or something similar. I'm really optimistic about my future. I have huge ambitions. I want to do a lot of good in this world. And I think that, you know, I wouldn't be in that place. I wouldn't be able to have those dreams if I didn't receive support from Michelle.

ANGUS GRANT, MICHELLE’S PARTNER: Michelle came home and said I’ve started seeing these trans kids…  and that hit a perfect storm of trans care becoming a much more public thing, together with Michelle’s extraordinary ability to organise things and get people together. 

Michelle: Thanks everyone for coming to our multi-disciplinary gender team meeting. 

ANGUS GRANT, MICHELLE’S PARTNER: And so the service exploded and the number of kids seeking assistance.

Michelle: Last year there was 473 new referrals, that was 2020 and in 2019 there was 336 and it’s a struggle obviously to fit everyone in.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: Of the hundreds of young people that come to our service, more than 20 per cent never go beyond that first assessment. We help them understand that it's okay to have behaviours that are not consistent with what we would expect stereotypically of being a boy or being a girl. But that doesn't mean that they're trans.

Dr Campbell Paul: Certainly now very keen to get some face to face appointments going again.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: For those who do feel that medical affirmation is necessary for them they’ll see a mental health person, either psychologist or psychiatrist, at least three times before they see anyone like a paediatrician or an endocrinologist who might start to consider whether a medication is going to be something that will help them. So the time taken from the time of referral to even getting to the paediatrician now is about two years.

I love working with these kids because they are incredibly brave. They’re actually coming to us in a situation which we know is very difficult for them.

(Four Corners, 2014)

Isabelle Langley: I just said to my mum that I didn’t wanna be a boy, I felt like a girl and I’m sick of living in this body.

Michelle Telfer: So Isabelle, do you have any questions for me?

Isabelle Langley: How do hormone blockers work?

Michelle Telfer: That is a very good question.

(Ends)

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: So when I first met Isabelle, she was a young girl who was pre puberty and she had as many trans young people do, a fear of going into puberty, where suddenly she would masculinised, if we didn't provide any care.

Michelle Telfer:  Now the good thing about the drug is it gives you time to think about what you want to do in the long term, without you having to worry about your voice dropping or getting hairy or any of those sorts of things.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: Isabelle was very clear about what she wanted to do and what she needed was puberty blockers. So we went through the risks and we went through the benefits. Puberty blockers are reversible. The only risk is that it can affect your bone density.

(Four Corners, 2014)

If you decided in a couple of years time, so you are 11 now, say you were 13, 14, or 15 and you thought, you know I don't want to be a female, I'm going to go back to being Campbell, then we can stop the Zoladex.

Isabelle Langley:  That won't happen, trust me (laughs).

Michelle Telfer:  No, you know what, I don't think that will happen either. But if it does happen we can stop this drug and your body goes back to how it would have been.

(Ends)

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: So what that did for Isabelle was give her time to get all the really and to mature cognitively and emotionally so that when the time came to making decisions about hormone treatments or oestrogen, which would have irreversible effects, she'd be competent to make that decision on her own before they were prescribed for Isabelle, both parents had to agree to the treatment.

ISABELLE LANGLEY: So I'm turning 18 later this year. I'm doing my final year of high school and VCE which is pretty exciting. I just feel like a normal kid, which I am.

Isabelle: I am thinking of probably doing politics, economics and philosophy.

ISABELLE LANGLEY: I don't know where I'd be if I didn't have Michelle and the RCH with me. Um. I think I would equate a large part of my being alive at the moment to them.

NAOMI LANGLEY, ISABELLE’S MOTHER: There were really dark times for Isabelle where her mental health was not great and she really struggled so getting the right treatment for her was critically important. I think that it has made all the difference in terms of who she is today.

Michelle: And what about your estrogen?

Isabelle: Yes good

ISABELLE LANGLEY: It's just a very thorough process. If you aren't actually trans, the hospital will figure it out. if the child maybe is confusing their feelings or something else, they'll figure it out. And for me specifically, the whole process was it felt like the hardest thing, like I had to re-explain myself all the time, reaffirm and prove myself to everyone so often. if at any moment I thought maybe I'm not trans, I would have stopped. 

ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR LIZ SCOTT, YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST: The diagnosis of  gender identity issues in young people is certainly a complex area and that’s because adolescence is a time of great change. In the UK, there's been a lot of attention from a case and  that has arisen out of one of the big UK centres, the Tavistock Clinic and  that has brought attention to young people who have transitioned during adolescence, teenage years, who then become very distressed and change their mind and wanted to de-transition.

BBC reporter: At 16 Keira was desperate to be a boy. She was given drugs to delay puberty then hormones...Keira believes it was a mistake.

Keira Bell: The discussions were very brief and no investigation into why I had dysphoric feelings.

ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR LIZ SCOTT: I think inevitably we will see some of those cases in Australia. My concerns about the explosions in presentations is that we don't have adequate resources and  young people  will go to other areas and that may be hormonal therapies on the black market or to practitioners that did not work within that multi-disciplinary frameworks and young people may get wrongly diagnosed. So I absolutely support the need for units like the one run by Michelle Telfer that provide the appropriate multidisciplinary care, that is accessible and is accountable.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: We've had five young people out of more than a thousand over the 15 years who have stopped taking oestrogen or testosterone. Some have ended identifying as non-binary -  one we know has de-transitioned.

MICHELLE TELFER: From the research, when they look at long term regret rate it's actually very small and it's somewhere in the range of zero point three to zero point six per cent. If you are to avoid providing care to everyone to try and get that regret rate down to zero, it means you're denying 99.5 per cent of all people who come to you the benefits of treatment.

DR SARAH MCNABB, DIR.GENERAL MEDICINE, RCH: I think this is an area that most doctors wouldn't want to touch because we know that it's controversial and it's not a surprise that parts of the media have come at Michelle for it.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: From August 2019 to the current time, the Australian newspaper has written nearly 50 articles about me and my work.So the newspaper is inferring that clinicians like me are harming children that it's experimental, that the care is novel and that they're potentially mentally ill and they're not really trans.

ISABELLE LANGLEY: I think publicising things, saying That our Gender affirming health care is Castrating us or saying that our very nature makes us mentally unstable and unwell, it just for me at least, it can make me feel a bit subhuman

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: One ne of the criticisms is that they can't provide a balanced story because I haven't engaged with them.

I feel very strongly that it's certainly not in the best interests of my patients to engage with the newspaper. They certainly weren't using all the published peer reviewed evidence to balance out their articles.I felt that they were never going to give me a fair hearing

(Media Watch, ABC)

Paul Barry: The Australian’s coverage is shamelessly one-eyed and so are many of the experts it relies on like John Whitehall.

 Voice: Castrating children is the phrase used by paediatrics professor John Whitehall to describe unscientific experimentation on youth in the name of transgenderism.

Paul Barry: John Whitehall is former deputy president of Fred Niles Christian Democratic Party. In 2017 he told 60 minutes: We’ve all got to believe that there is no such thing as a boy or a girl, that we all somewhere in between and I don’t believe that.

(Ends)

Michelle: Hello Minister how are you?

MARTIN FOLEY, VICTORIAN HEALTH MINISTER: The commentators that the Australian chose to highlight in its campaign did not bring any credibility in this speciality field of paediatrics. I thought it was ill advised and it needed to stop.

Michelle and the whole gender unit, the children's not just Australia's leading centre for this important work, but recognised globally developing the models of care, testing that, putting it out to peer review, being lauded by the Lancet.

ASSOC. PROFESSOR LIZ SCOTT: I think if anything has come out of the media coverage, it has highlighted the need for more debate, for more informed debate in this area and for the community as a whole to consider where what the appropriate checks and balances are and to make sure that as a community, we feel happy with that. However, when the media targets individuals such as Michelle Telfer, who by all standards are running the appropriate and highly recognised service I think that is extremely concerning.

Angus Grant: The hospital has been very busy hasn’t it?

Michelle: Yeah, every day new kids coming in

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: I'd wake up halfway through the night and be awake for hours and every morning I just suddenly have this tightness in my chest nd just I knew it was anxiety. At one stage I even saw a cardiologist and saw a psychiatrist just to try and work out ways of, um, moving past it.

ANGUS GRANT, MICHELLE’S PARTNER: You are helpless to do anything about it. You can be there and listen to the stories and give her a hug but you cant fix it. She'll break down at times, but then she's getting on with the running of things

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: When the short-term risk of not providing care is severe depression and anxiety, self-harm and young people attempting suicide, we know that we can't do. Doing nothing is actually exposing young people to the risk of harm. 

ELLIOT NICHOLAS: I was 10 when I first realised I was transgender and I was 15 when I came out. My parents are church ministers and so I didn't know how my family would react.

REVEREND WILL NICHOLAS, ELLIOT’S FATHER: Shortly before Elliot came into the age of puberty, we could see that that Elliott was withdrawing socially.

ELLIOT NICHOLAS: I was receiving notes from classmates, telling me that I'm better off dead. That I don't deserve love, that I'm an abomination. I didn't feel like I deserved to live anymore

REVEREND WILL NICHOLAS, ELLIOT’S FATHER: We became aware of incidents of self-harm, through substance abuse, alcohol and and also by cutting himself…Sorry, it's a little hard to talk about because it's such a hard time of life. And that resulted in him attempting to take his own life

ELLOIT NICHOLAS: I was sitting in my room and my dad came to check in on me and he said, are you Are you OK? And I said, No, I'm not OK. and I said, Dad, I just want to die. I want to end my life. I'm afraid that I'm going to kill myself today’.

REVEREND WILL NICHOLAS, ELLIOT’S FATHER: I packed him up and took him down to our local casualty. He was actually able to tell me about his gender dysphoria

ELLIOT NICHOLAS: I had this realisation that I am transgender, and I can’t just pretend that I am not.

And he sat there with me and he just said, I love you. And I just cried. I just I couldn't contain myself.

REVEREND WILL NICHOLAS, ELLIOT’S FATHER:  And I was able to embrace him and tell him that my love for him was unconditional. And d he always brightened straight away?

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: What we have seen with Elliot over the last year is thriving young man who has been incredibly positive in terms of influencing his own community.

ELLIOT NICHOLAS: I'm the vice-captain of my school that I go to, and I'm also the junior mayor of Geelong. Most of my mental health that I have this day is because of the amount of support and respect and love that I've been given being transgender and transitioning.

 Michelle Telfer: How are you? Great to see you in the flesh

Elliot: I know right it’s been a while

REVEREND WILL NICHOLAS, ELLIOT’S FATHER: That information that's presented in newspapers is just not consistent with our experience of journeying with Elliot to where he is today.

Michelle Telfer: So tell me how was your first testosterone shot?

Elliot: It was a bit painful, but it was very exciting. I was very happy to have it after two and half years.

REVEREND WILL NICHOLAS, ELLIOT’S FATHER: It's been a long journey. There has been considerable psychological assessment.

Elliot: I notice my voice has started to crack.

REVEREND WILL NICHOLAS, ELLIOT’S FATHER: And as parents, we felt we feel like we've been consulted every step of the way.

REBEKAH ROBERTSON, TRANSCEND FAMILY AND PEER SUPPORT: People who really would prefer trans kids not to be receiving gender affirming treatment started to started to lobby the government and ask that there be an enquiry into the medical treatment of trans kids but rather than an inquiry, Minister Hunt referred it on to the Royal Australasian College of Physicians for a review.

DR SARAH MCNAB, DIR. GENERAL MEDICINE, RCH: There was an incredible amount of pressure on Michelle as the findings were due to be handed down. She was very concerned that the clinic might be closed and that that might have a domino effect on services around the country. When the colleges report was handed down, it was incredibly validating for Michelle and her team. They actually recommended that services be expanded around the country.

REBEKAH ROBERTSON, TRANSCEND FAMILY AND PEER SUPPORT:  I remember speaking to Michelle and just going. They get it, they understand that an enquiry would expose our kids to unnecessary debate about their existence and experience.

MARTIN FOLEY, VIC HEALTH MINISTER: I've got to give Greg Hunt and the federal government kudos where it's due. They withstood that pressure, they stared it down and they said let the clinical evidence speak for itself and use the clinical processes that the college had to review it and for it to determine the outcome. What was really concerning was even with the colleges report, the Australian newspaper continued to publish articles.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: I decided that I needed to actively punch back. So I took a week off from my usual work and I sat down with every single article that had been written that referenced me. There are nearly 300 mentions of me and my work.  I submitted the 42-page complaint to the Australian Press Council last year,

ANGUS GRANT, MICHELLE’S PARTNER: Since putting in the complaint to the press council. She's just felt in control now and having taken the fight to them a bit, she feels less of that, I think feels less of a victim.

 MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: I'm waiting for an adjudication but what's been helpful for me is actually going through that process because really the outcome of the adjudication is somewhat irrelevant because the process has helped me understand that, I'm really comfortable with where I am and what I'm doing.

Michelle: How are you feeling about transitioning into adult services.

ANGUS GRANT, MICHELLE’S PARTNER: I don't really wish that she'd done something a bit safer.

Isabelle Langley: I just know everyone like you and Campbell really well. I am going to miss that.

ANGUS GRANT, MICHELLE’S PARTNER: I think, you know, that the gratitude she gets from these kids is extraordinary. It’s not like she did an operation and they’re better. She sees these kids over the years and she helps change their life.

Michelle: It has been important for us as well seeing how well you’ve done and seeing you grow up.

MICHELLE TELFER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, ROYAL CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE: I am absolutely optimistic about the future, and I know that what we are doing is the right thing. Society has tried to ignore trans people for hundreds and hundreds of years, but now that we're affirming them, now that we're giving them a voice, look what that can do.

END CAPTION: The Australian Newspaper declined an interview but said: “the key issue is the welfare of vulnerable children and adolescents, and that’s why there is an international expert debate about the ‘affirmative’ model of medicalised gender change”.
