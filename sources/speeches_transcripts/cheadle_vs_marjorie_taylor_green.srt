1
00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:03,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Chair now recognizes Miss Marjorie Taylor-Green from Georgia.

2
00:00:03,752 --> 00:00:04,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

3
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss Cheadle, I'd like to remind you that you're under oath.

4
00:00:09,596 --> 00:00:18,061
[SPEAKER_01]: The site team has a senior supervisor, an advanced team, a protective intelligence team, a counter sniper element, and detail.

5
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:20,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was the agent in charge?

6
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:22,804
[SPEAKER_01]: How long has she been the agent in charge?

7
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,926
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is her Secret Service background?

8
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not going to provide a name.

9
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:30,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?

10
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,393
[SPEAKER_01]: You're here to answer our questions for him.

11
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to provide names of you stated in your testimony.

12
00:00:37,176 --> 00:00:40,258
[SPEAKER_01]: You said I am here today to answer your questions.

13
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:42,319
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Answer the question.

15
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:47,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to provide names of our personnel.

16
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:49,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?

17
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:53,318
[SPEAKER_01]: The American people are demanding these answers from you today, Ms.

18
00:00:53,338 --> 00:00:53,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheadle.

19
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:59,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I will do the best to provide you accurate information based on the facts that I have at this time.

20
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,702
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not answering our questions.

21
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:09,385
[SPEAKER_01]: The advance element coordinates with other Intel or law enforcement partners, identifies threats and weaknesses at the sites and movements.

22
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:11,666
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like a copy of the advance report.

23
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:13,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you brought it here with you today?

24
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:17,350
[SPEAKER_02]: We will comply with the request for the documentation that has been requested.

25
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,511
[SPEAKER_01]: When will that be, Ms.

26
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:20,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheadle, because you should have brought it today.

27
00:01:20,152 --> 00:01:25,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I am certain that our personnel are working on obtaining all of that document.

28
00:01:25,196 --> 00:01:28,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe you, and neither do the people watching this hearing.

29
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:32,202
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing well, as Mr. Moskowitz informed you.

30
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:43,032
[SPEAKER_01]: You have been sitting here for over three hours and I have you know the entire country is demanding you resign and demanding that you be fired if you do not resign.

31
00:01:43,332 --> 00:01:44,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are not going well for you.

32
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:46,014
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to answer the questions.

33
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:55,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a protective intelligence team and what technical resources were utilized for that event, specifically drone or helicopter assets?

34
00:01:56,837 --> 00:02:04,880
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a number of technical assets that were deployed for that event, and there was a protective intelligence team that was assigned to that event.

35
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:14,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Why was Crooks able to fly a drone over the entire area the day of the rally and the day of his assassination attempt?

36
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:18,465
[SPEAKER_02]: To my knowledge, he did not fly the drone over the entire area.

37
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,726
[SPEAKER_01]: How did he fly a drone over the area, period?

38
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:21,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Any part of the area?

39
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:29,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I would have to go back and check the timeline of when that took place and when the... 

00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:31,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't you bring the timeline with you today to answer our questions?

40
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:34,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have all of the answers on the timelines based on the criminal investigation.

41
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you not prepared today to answer our questions?

42
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:49,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I am prepared to answer the questions based on the information and wanted to be able to provide... 

00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:51,035
[SPEAKER_01]: 
Do you have a timeline that you... Do you have a timeline, at all, from any of the day?

43
00:02:50,842 --> 00:02:54,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a timeline that does not have specifics.

44
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:57,307
[SPEAKER_01]: That's shocking.

45
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:01,050
[SPEAKER_01]: That is absolutely unacceptable.

46
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:03,953
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you are a failure at your job.

47
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:07,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about things that are prohibited in Trump rallies.

48
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been to a lot of Trump rallies.

49
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:11,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Backpacks and bags.

50
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Bicycles.

51
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:15,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Firearms.

52
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:26,481
[SPEAKER_01]: any type of weapon or any other item determined to be a potential safety hazard, like a range finder would be one.

53
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:32,643
[SPEAKER_01]: At 5:10, Crooks is first observed by one of the snipers, ATR Sniper One, at the building.

54
00:03:33,384 --> 00:03:39,125
[SPEAKER_01]: 5:10, President Trump was shot in the face at 6-11 p.m.

55
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:45,768
[SPEAKER_01]: 5:28, ATR Sniper One takes a picture of a bicycle in two bags.

56
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Those belong to Crooks.

57
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:54,294
[SPEAKER_01]: 5:32, AGR Sniper One spots Crooks looking at his phone and using a range finder.

58
00:03:54,314 --> 00:04:03,738
[SPEAKER_01]: 5:55, Butler ESU Command confirms receipt of photos and states they have been relayed on.

59
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:13,283
[SPEAKER_01]: 6:05 PM, AGR Sniper One later communicates that Crooks is seen moving northeast in direction of Sheets and that Crooks has a backpack.

60
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:35,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Two minutes before the shooting, while President Trump has been allowed to take the stage, people see Crooks laying on his stomach in a sniper position on the roof, and they're yelling he has a gun, and they are trying to alert law enforcement and Secret Service.

61
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:40,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Why was Crooks not shot by the snipers?

62
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:42,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Why was he allowed to be there?

63
00:04:44,423 --> 00:04:49,507
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as the individual was identified as a threat, they were... 

64
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:51,309
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no, no. What do you consider to be a threat?

65
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,151
[SPEAKER_01]: A man with a gun laying in a sniper position?

66
00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:55,892
[SPEAKER_01]: A man that had a backpack?

67
00:04:56,152 --> 00:04:57,453
[SPEAKER_01]: A man that had a bicycle?

68
00:04:57,754 --> 00:04:59,735
[SPEAKER_01]: A man that had a range finder?

69
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:03,178
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point is he determined a threat?

70
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,782
[SPEAKER_02]: An individual with a backpack is not a threat.

71
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:11,625
[SPEAKER_02]: An individual with a range finder is not a threat.

72
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:22,589
[SPEAKER_01]: What about a man laying on a building that has direct line of sight of President Trump with a gun that people are screaming and pointing out?

73
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:24,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a threat, Ms.

74
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheadle?

75
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:28,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Once that individual was identified, they were neutralized.

76
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,255
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they were neutralized.

77
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:35,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Crooks was neutralized after he shot President Trump in the face, Ms.

78
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:36,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheadle.

79
00:05:37,398 --> 00:05:39,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Is he only a threat once he fires the weapon?

80
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,786
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as the counter sniper identified that individual, they were able to neutralize them.

81
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:48,447
[SPEAKER_01]: How were people in the crowd?

82
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:50,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, then let's just take it this way.

83
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:58,418
[SPEAKER_01]: People under your command did not consider him to be a threat, yet people in the crowd knew he had a gun and considered him to be a threat.

84
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:11,885
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that you are a complete failure as the director of the Secret Service, that people under your command don't perceive a man laying on a roof with direct line to the president with a gun.

85
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,626
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't perceive that to be a threat, yet the people in the crowd do.

86
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:17,187
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that possible?

87
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,308
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the last question, but please answer the question, Ms.

88
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:21,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Director.

89
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:28,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not certain at this time how the information from the people in the crowd was relayed to any law enforcement personnel.

90
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:30,836
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you knew that everyone knew.

91
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:34,237
[SPEAKER_01]: The people there knew that there was a danger.

92
00:06:34,297 --> 00:06:38,079
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew there was a threat to President Trump, and it was allowed to happen.

93
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:39,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a stand-down order, Ms.

94
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheadle?

95
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a conspiracy to kill President Trump?

96
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:44,322
[SPEAKER_02]: No. Absolutely not.

97
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:45,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Then how did this happen?

98
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:50,965
[SPEAKER_01]: And why are you still sitting here, not turning in your letter of resignation?

99
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:54,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Last question, but please answer and then I'll recognize Ms.

100
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:54,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Presley.

101
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:55,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Please [Speaker_02] do answer the question.

102
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,499
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what we are investigating to determine.

103
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,660
[SPEAKER_01]: We're waiting for your letter.

104
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,181
[SPEAKER_01]: We're waiting for your letter of resignation.

105
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:06,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really need to consider doing that before you leave today.

106
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:08,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Chair to recognize Ms.

107
00:07:08,402 --> 00:07:09,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Presley from Massachusetts.

108
00:07:10,683 --> 00:07:11,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

8
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,010
[SPEAKER_02][Stonewalling]: So I'm not going to provide a name.
9
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:30,811

10
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,393

[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Answer the question.
15
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:47,143

00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:29,048
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: Again, I would have to go back and check the timeline of when that took place and when the...
38
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:31,766
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: Why didn't you bring the timeline with you today to answer our questions?
39
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:34,950
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: I don't have all of the answers on the timelines based on the criminal investigation.
40
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,591
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: Were you not prepared today to answer our questions?
41
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:49,035
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: I am prepared to answer the questions based on the information and wanted to be able to provide...

00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:51,035
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Do you have a timeline that you... Do you have a timeline, at all, from any of the day?
43
00:02:50,842 --> 00:02:54,625
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: I have a timeline that does not have specifics.
44
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:57,307
[SPEAKER_01][Sarcasm/Irony]: That's shocking.
45
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:01,050
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: That is absolutely unacceptable.
46
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:03,953
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: That means you are a failure at your job.
47
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:07,375
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: Let's talk about things that are prohibited in Trump rallies.
48
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,796
[SPEAKER_01][Appeal to Authority]: And I've been to a lot of Trump rallies.
49
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:11,358
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: Backpacks and bags.
50
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,780
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: Bicycles.
51
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:15,542
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: Firearms.
52
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:26,481
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: any type of weapon or any other item determined to be a potential safety hazard, like a range finder would be one.
53
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:32,643
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: At 5:10, Crooks is first observed by one of the snipers, ATR Sniper One, at the building.
54
00:03:33,384 --> 00:03:39,125
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: 5:10, President Trump was shot in the face at 6-11 p.m.
55
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:45,768
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: 5:28, ATR Sniper One takes a picture of a bicycle in two bags.
56
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,171
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: Those belong to Crooks.
57
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:54,294
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: 5:32, AGR Sniper One spots Crooks looking at his phone and using a range finder.
58
00:03:54,314 --> 00:04:03,738
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: 5:55, Butler ESU Command confirms receipt of photos and states they have been relayed on.
59
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:13,283
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation]: 6:05 PM, AGR Sniper One later communicates that Crooks is seen moving northeast in direction of Sheets and that Crooks has a backpack.
60
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:35,993
[SPEAKER_01][Fact Presentation][Accusation]: Two minutes before the shooting, while President Trump has been allowed to take the stage, people see Crooks laying on his stomach in a sniper position on the roof, and they're yelling he has a gun, and they are trying to alert law enforcement and Secret Service.
61
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:40,657
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity][Accusation]: Why was Crooks not shot by the snipers?
62
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:42,698
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity][Accusation]: Why was he allowed to be there?
63
00:04:44,423 --> 00:04:49,507
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: As soon as the individual was identified as a threat, they were...
64
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:51,309
[SPEAKER_01][Interruption][Frustration]: No, no, no, no, no, no. What do you consider to be a threat?
65
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,151
[SPEAKER_01][Rhetorical Question]: A man with a gun laying in a sniper position?
66
00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:55,892
[SPEAKER_01][Rhetorical Question]: A man that had a backpack?
67
00:04:56,152 --> 00:04:57,453
[SPEAKER_01][Rhetorical Question]: A man that had a bicycle?
68
00:04:57,754 --> 00:04:59,735
[SPEAKER_01][Rhetorical Question]: A man that had a range finder?
69
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:03,178
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: At what point is he determined a threat?
70
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,782
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: An individual with a backpack is not a threat.
71
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:11,625
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: An individual with a range finder is not a threat.
72
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:22,589
[SPEAKER_01][Rhetorical Question][Accusation]: What about a man laying on a building that has direct line of sight of President Trump with a gun that people are screaming and pointing out?
73
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:24,590
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Is that a threat, Ms. Cheadle?
75
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:28,973
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: Once that individual was identified, they were neutralized.
76
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:31,255
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: No, they were neutralized.
77
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:36,398
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: Crooks was neutralized after he shot President Trump in the face, Ms. Cheadle.
79
00:05:37,398 --> 00:05:39,680
[SPEAKER_01][Rhetorical Question][Sarcasm/Irony]: Is he only a threat once he fires the weapon?
80
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,786
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: As soon as the counter sniper identified that individual, they were able to neutralize them.
81
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:48,447
[SPEAKER_01][Interruption]: How were people in the crowd?
82
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:50,410
[SPEAKER_01][Interruption]: Okay, then let's just take it this way.
83
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:58,418
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: People under your command did not consider him to be a threat, yet people in the crowd knew he had a gun and considered him to be a threat.
84
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:11,885
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation][Appeal to Public Interest]: That means that you are a complete failure as the director of the Secret Service, that people under your command don't perceive a man laying on a roof with direct line to the president with a gun.
85
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,626
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: They don't perceive that to be a threat, yet the people in the crowd do.
86
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:17,187
[SPEAKER_01][Rhetorical Question]: How is that possible?
87
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:21,069
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the last question, but please answer the question, Ms. Director.
89
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:28,312
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: I'm not certain at this time how the information from the people in the crowd was relayed to any law enforcement personnel.
90
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:30,836
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: No, you knew that everyone knew.
91
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:34,237
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: The people there knew that there was a danger.
92
00:06:34,297 --> 00:06:38,079
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: They knew there was a threat to President Trump, and it was allowed to happen.
93
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:40,060
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Was there a stand-down order, Ms. Cheadle?
95
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,181
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation]: Was there a conspiracy to kill President Trump?
96
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:44,322
[SPEAKER_02][Stonewalling]: No. Absolutely not.
97
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:45,963
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: Then how did this happen?
98
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:50,965
[SPEAKER_01][Accusation][Implied Threat]: And why are you still sitting here, not turning in your letter of resignation?
99
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Last question, but please answer and then I'll recognize Ms. Presley. Please [Speaker_02] do answer the question.
102
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,499
[SPEAKER_02][Deflection]: That is what we are investigating to determine.
103
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,660
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: We're waiting for your letter.
104
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,181
[SPEAKER_01][Demand for Specificity]: We're waiting for your letter of resignation.
105
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:06,242
[SPEAKER_01][Implied Threat]: And you really need to consider doing that before you leave today.
106
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:11,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Chair to recognize Ms. Presley from Massachusetts. Thank you.
