Log of sequentialthinking tool calls for the Spy/Knight/Knave puzzle.

This file contains the raw tool calls and responses that formed the "memory" or "thinking process" for solving the puzzle.

--- CALL 1 ---
[tool_call: sequentialthinking for {'thought': 'Hypothesis: A is the Spy. This means B and C must be the Knight and the Knave (in some order). Let\'s test their statements.\n- B says: "A is the Knight." Since we know A is the Spy, this statement is false. Therefore, B must be the Knave.\n- This means C must be the Knight.\n- C says: "I am the Spy." Since C is the Knight, this statement must be true. But we assumed A is the Spy. This is a contradiction.\n- Conclusion: This branch is invalid. A cannot be the Spy.', 'next_thought_needed': True, 'thought_number': 2, 'total_thoughts': 4, 'branch_from_thought': 1, 'branch_id': 'A_is_Spy'}]

--- CALL 2 ---
[tool_call: sequentialthinking for {'thought': 'Hypothesis: B is the Spy. This means A and C must be the Knight and the Knave.\n- C says: "I am the Spy." We know B is the Spy, so this is a false statement. Therefore, C must be the Knave.\n- This means A must be the Knight.\n- Let\'s check A\'s statement. A says: "C is the Knave." Since A is the Knight, this must be true. Our deductions show that C is indeed the Knave.\n- Let\'s check B\'s statement. B is the Spy and can lie or tell the truth. B says: "A is the Knight." This is true.\n- All statements are consistent with this assignment.\n- Conclusion: This is a valid solution. A is the Knight, B is the Spy, C is the Knave.', 'next_thought_needed': True, 'thought_number': 3, 'total_thoughts': 4, 'branch_from_thought': 1, 'branch_id': 'B_is_Spy'}]

--- CALL 3 ---
[tool_call: sequentialthinking for {'thought': 'Hypothesis: C is the Spy. This means A and B must be the Knight and the Knave.\n- C says: "I am the Spy." Since C is the Spy, this statement could be true.\n- B says: "A is the Knight." Let\'s test this.\n- If A is the Knight, then B must be the Knave.\n- Let\'s check A\'s statement. A says: "C is the Knave." Since A is the Knight, this must be true. But we assumed C is the Spy. This is a contradiction.\n- So, the other possibility in this branch is that A is the Knave and B is the Knight.\n- If A is the Knave, his statement "C is the Knave" must be false. This means C is not the Knave, which is consistent with C being the Spy.\n- If B is the Knight, his statement "A is the Knight" must be true. But we assumed A is the Knave. This is a contradiction.\n- Conclusion: Both possibilities within this branch lead to a contradiction. C cannot be the Spy.', 'next_thought_needed': True, 'thought_number': 4, 'total_thoughts': 4, 'branch_from_thought': 1, 'branch_id': 'C_is_Spy'}]
